          A lad named Jack was once so unhappy at home through his father's ill-  treatment, that he made up his mind to run away and seek his fortune  in the wide world.
          He ran, and he ran, till he could run no longer, and then he ran right  up against a little old woman who was gathering sticks. He was too  much out of breath to beg pardon, but the woman was good-natured, and  she said he seemed to be a likely lad, so she would take him to be her  servant, and would pay him well. He agreed, for he was very hungry,  and she brought him to her house in the wood, where he served her for  a twelvemonths and a day.
          When the year had passed, she called him to her, and said she had good  wages for him. So she presented him with an ass out of the stable, and  he had but to pull Neddy's ears to make him begin at once to ee&mdash;aw!  And when he brayed there dropped from his mouth silver sixpences, and  half crowns, and golden guineas.
          The lad was well pleased with the wage he had received, and away he  rode till he reached an inn. There he ordered the best of everything,  and when the innkeeper refused to serve him without being paid  beforehand, the boy went off to the stable, pulled the ass's ears and  obtained his pocket full of money. The host had watched all this  through a crack in the door, and when night came on he put an ass of  his own for the precious Neddy of the poor youth. So Jack without  knowing that any change had been made, rode away next morning to his  father's house.
          Now, I must tell you that near his home dwelt a poor widow with an  only daughter. The lad and the maiden were fast friends and true  loves; but when Jack asked his father's leave to marry the girl,  &quot;Never till you have the money to keep her,&quot; was the reply. &quot;I have  that, father,&quot; said the lad, and going to the ass he pulled its long  ears; well, he pulled, and he pulled, till one of them came off in his  hands; but Neddy, though he hee-hawed and he hee-hawed let fall no  half crowns or guineas. The father picked up a hay-fork and beat his  son out of the house. I promise you he ran. Ah! he ran and ran till he  came bang against the door, and burst it open, and there he was in a  joiner's shop. &quot;You're a likely lad,&quot; said the joiner; &quot;serve me for a  twelvemonths and a day and I will pay you well.'&quot; So he agreed, and  served the carpenter for a year and a day. &quot;Now,&quot; said the master, &quot;I  will give you your wage;&quot; and he presented him with a table, telling  him he had but to say, &quot;Table, be covered,&quot; and at once it would be  spread with lots to eat and drink.
          Jack hitched the table on his back, and away he went with it till he  came to the inn. &quot;Well, host,&quot; shouted he, &quot;my dinner to-day, and that  of the best.&quot;
          &quot;Very sorry, but there is nothing in the house but ham and eggs.&quot;
          &quot;Ham and eggs for me!&quot; exclaimed Jack. &quot;I can do better than that.&mdash;
            Come, my table, be covered!&quot;
          
          At once the table was spread with turkey and sausages, roast mutton,  potatoes, and greens. The publican opened his eyes, but he said  nothing, not he.
          That night he fetched down from his attic a table very like that of  Jack, and exchanged the two. Jack, none the wiser, next morning  hitched the worthless table on to his back and carried it home. &quot;Now,  father, may I marry my lass?&quot; he asked.
          &quot;Not unless you can keep her,&quot; replied the father. &quot;Look here!&quot;  exclaimed Jack. &quot;Father, I have a table which does all my bidding.&quot;
          &quot;Let me see it,&quot; said the old man.
          The lad set it in the middle of the room, and bade it be covered; but  all in vain, the table remained bare. In a rage, the father caught the  warming-pan down from the wall and warmed his son's back with it so  that the boy fled howling from the house, and ran and ran till he came  to a river and tumbled in. A man picked him out and bade him assist  him in making a bridge over the river; and how do you think he was  doing it? Why, by casting a tree across; so Jack climbed up to the top  of the tree and threw his weight on it, so that when the man had  rooted the tree up, Jack and the tree-head dropped on the farther  bank.
          &quot;Thank you,&quot; said the man; &quot;and now for what you have done I will pay  you;&quot; so saying, he tore a branch from the tree, and fettled it up  into a club with his knife. &quot;There,&quot; exclaimed he; &quot;take this stick,  and when you say to it, 'Up stick and bang him,' it will knock any one  down who angers you.&quot;
          The lad was overjoyed to get this stick&mdash;so away he went with it to  the inn, and as soon as the publican, appeared, &quot;Up stick and bang  him!&quot; was his cry. At the word the cudgel flew from his hand and  battered the old publican on the back, rapped his head, bruised his  arms tickled his ribs, till he fell groaning on the floor; still the  stick belaboured the prostrate man, nor would Jack call it off till he  had got back the stolen ass and table. Then he galloped home on the  ass, with the table on his shoulders, and the stick in his hand. When  he arrived there he found his father was dead, so he brought his ass  into the stable, and pulled its ears till he had filled the manger  with money.
          It was soon known through the town that Jack had returned rolling in  wealth, and accordingly all the girls in the place set their caps at  him. &quot;Now,&quot; said Jack, &quot;I shall marry the richest lass in the place;  so tomorrow do you all come in front of my house with your money in  your aprons.&quot;
          Next morning the street was full of girls with aprons held out, and  gold and silver in them; but Jack's own sweetheart was among them, and  she had neither gold nor silver, nought but two copper pennies, that  was all she had.
          &quot;Stand aside, lass;&quot; said Jack to her, speaking roughly. &quot;Thou hast no  silver nor gold&mdash;stand off from the rest.&quot; She obeyed, and the tears  ran down her cheeks, and filled her apron with diamonds.
          &quot;Up stick and bang them!&quot; exclaimed Jack; whereupon the cudgel leaped  up, and running along the line of girls, knocked them all on the heads  and left them senseless on the pavement. Jack took all their money and  poured it into his truelove's lap. &quot;Now, lass,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;thou  art the richest, and I shall marry thee.&quot;
