          A woman was sitting at her reel one night; And still she sat, and  still she reeled, and still she wished for company.
          In came a pair of broad broad soles, and sat down at the fireside;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a pair of small small legs, and sat down on the broad broad  soles;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a pair of thick thick knees, and sat down on the small small  legs;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a pair of thin thin thighs, and sat down on the thick thick  knees;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a pair of huge huge hips, and sat down on the thin thin  thighs;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a wee wee waist, and sat down on the huge huge hips;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a pair of broad broad shoulders, and sat down on the wee wee  waist;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a pair of small small arms, and sat down on the broad broad  shoulders;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a pair of huge huge hands, and sat down on the small small  arms;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a small small neck, and sat down on the broad broad shoulders;
          And still she sat, and still she reeled, and still she wished for  company.
          In came a huge huge head, and sat down on the small small neck.
