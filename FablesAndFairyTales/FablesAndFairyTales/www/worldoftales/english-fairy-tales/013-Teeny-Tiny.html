          Once upon a time there was a teeny-tiny woman lived in a teeny-tiny  house in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one day this teeny-tiny woman put  on her teeny-tiny bonnet, and went out of her teeny-tiny house to take  a teeny-tiny walk. And when this teeny-tiny woman had gone a teeny-  tiny way she came to a teeny-tiny gate; so the teeny-tiny woman opened  the teeny-tiny gate, and went into a teeny-tiny churchyard. And when  this teeny-tiny woman had got into the teeny-tiny churchyard, she saw  a teeny-tiny bone on a teeny-tiny grave, and the teeny-tiny woman said  to her teeny-tiny self, &quot;This teeny-tiny bone will make me some teeny-  tiny soup for my teeny-tiny supper.&quot; So the teeny-tiny woman put the  teeny-tiny bone into her teeny-tiny pocket, and went home to her  teeny-tiny house.
          Now when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny house she was  a teeny-tiny bit tired; so she went up her teeny-tiny stairs to her  teeny-tiny bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny  cupboard. And when this teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep a teeny-  tiny time, she was awakened by a teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny  cupboard, which said:
          &quot;Give me my bone!&quot;
          And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny frightened, so she hid her  teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes and went to sleep again.  And when she had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny  voice again cried out from the teeny-tiny cupboard a teeny-tiny  louder, &quot;Give me my bone!&quot;
          This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened, so she  hid her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny further under the teeny-tiny  clothes. And when the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep again a  teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard  said again a teeny-tiny louder,
          &quot;Give me my bone!&quot;
          And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit more frightened, but  she put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny clothes, and said in  her loudest teeny-tiny voice, &quot;TAKE IT!&quot;
