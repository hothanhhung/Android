          When good King Arthur reigned, there lived near the Land's End of  England, in the county of Cornwall, a farmer who had one only son  called Jack. He was brisk and of a ready lively wit, so that nobody or  nothing could worst him.
          In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge giant named  Cormoran. He was eighteen feet in height, and about three yards round  the waist, of a fierce and grim countenance, the terror of all the  neighbouring towns and villages. He lived in a cave in the midst of  the Mount, and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to the main-  land, where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way.  Everybody at his approach ran out of their houses, while he seized on  their cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his back  at a time; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would tie them round  his waist like a bunch of tallow-dips. He had done this for many  years, so that all Cornwall was in despair.
          One day Jack happened to be at the town-hall when the magistrates were  sitting in council about the Giant. He asked: &quot;What reward will be  given to the man who kills Cormoran?&quot; &quot;The giant's treasure,&quot; they  said, &quot;will be the reward.&quot; Quoth Jack: &quot;Then let me undertake it.&quot;
          So he got a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in  the beginning of a dark winter's evening, when he fell to work, and  before morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as  broad, covering it over with long sticks and straw. Then he strewed a  little mould over it, so that it appeared like plain ground. Jack then  placed himself on the opposite side of the pit, farthest from the  giant's lodging, and, just at the break of day, he put the horn to his  mouth, and blew, Tantivy, Tantivy. This noise roused the giant, who  rushed from his cave, crying: &quot;You incorrigible villain, are you come  here to disturb my rest? You shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I  will have, and this it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you  for breakfast.&quot; He had no sooner uttered this, than he tumbled into  the pit, and made the very foundations of the Mount to shake. &quot;Oh,  Giant,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;where are you now? Oh, faith, you are gotten now  into Lob's Pound, where I will surely plague you for your threatening  words: what do you think now of broiling me for your breakfast? Will  no other diet serve you but poor Jack?&quot; Then having tantalised the  giant for a while, he gave him a most weighty knock with his pickaxe  on the very crown of his head, and killed him on the spot.
          Jack then filled up the pit with earth, and went to search the cave,  which he found contained much treasure. When the magistrates heard of  this they made a declaration he should henceforth be termed
          JACK THE GIANT-KILLER
          and presented him with a sword and a belt, on which were written these  words embroidered in letters of gold:
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here's the right valiant Cornish man,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Who slew the giant Cormoran.&quot;
          
          The news of Jack's victory soon spread over all the West of England,  so that another giant, named Blunderbore, hearing of it, vowed to be  revenged on Jack, if ever he should light on him. This giant was the  lord of an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lonesome wood.  Now Jack, about four months afterwards, walking near this wood in his  journey to Wales, being weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain  and fell fast asleep. While he was sleeping, the giant, coming there  for water, discovered him, and knew him to be the far-famed Jack the  Giant-killer by the lines written on the belt. Without ado, he took  Jack on his shoulders and carried him towards his castle. Now, as they  passed through a thicket, the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack,  who was strangely surprised to find himself in the clutches of the  giant. His terror was only begun, for, on entering the castle, he saw  the ground strewed with human bones, and the giant told him his own  would ere long be among them. After this the giant locked poor Jack in  an immense chamber, leaving him there while he went to fetch another  giant, his brother, living in the same wood, who might share in the  meal on Jack.
          After waiting some time Jack, on going to the window beheld afar off  the two giants coming towards the castle. &quot;Now,&quot; quoth Jack to  himself, &quot;my death or my deliverance is at hand.&quot; Now, there were  strong cords in a corner of the room in which Jack was, and two of  these he took, and made a strong noose at the end; and while the  giants were unlocking the iron gate of the castle he threw the ropes  over each of their heads. Then he drew the other ends across a beam,  and pulled with all his might, so that he throttled them. Then, when  he saw they were black in the face, he slid down the rope, and drawing  his sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant's keys, and  unlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies tied by the hair of  their heads, almost starved to death. &quot;Sweet ladies,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;I  have destroyed this monster and his brutish brother, and obtained your  liberties.&quot; This said he presented them with the keys, and so  proceeded on his journey to Wales.
          Jack made the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could, but  lost his road, and was benighted, and could find any habitation until,  coming into a narrow valley, he found a large house, and in order to  get shelter took courage to knock at the gate. But what was his  surprise when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads; yet  he did not appear so fiery as the others were, for he was a Welsh  giant, and what he did was by private and secret malice under the  false show of friendship. Jack, having told his condition to the  giant, was shown into a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard  his host in another apartment muttering these words:
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Though here you lodge with me this night,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not see the morning light
  &nbsp;&nbsp;My club shall dash your brains outright!&quot;
          
          &quot;Say'st thou so,&quot; quoth Jack; &quot;that is like one of your Welsh tricks,  yet I hope to be cunning enough for you.&quot; Then, getting out of bed, he  laid a billet in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a corner of  the room. At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who  struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, thinking he had  broken every bone in Jack's skin. The next morning Jack, laughing in  his sleeve, gave him hearty thanks for his night's lodging. &quot;How have  you rested?&quot; quoth the giant; &quot;did you not feel anything in the  night?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;nothing but a rat, which gave me two or  three slaps with her tail.&quot; With that, greatly wondering, the giant  led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl containing four gallons of  hasty pudding. Being loth to let the giant think it too much for him,  Jack put a large leather bag under his loose coat, in such a way that  he could convey the pudding into it without its being perceived. Then,  telling the giant he would show him a trick, taking a knife, Jack  ripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty pudding. Whereupon,  saying, &quot;Odds splutters hur nails, hur can do that trick hurself,&quot; the  monster took the knife, and ripping open his belly, fell down dead.
          Now, it happened in these days that King Arthur's only son asked his  father to give him a large sum of money, in order that he might go and  seek his fortune in the principality of Wales, where lived a beautiful  lady possessed with seven evil spirits. The king did his best to  persuade his son from it, but in vain; so at last gave way and the  prince set out with two horses, one loaded with money, the other for  himself to ride upon. Now, after several days' travel, he came to a  market-town in Wales, where he beheld a vast crowd of people gathered  together. The prince asked the reason of it, and was told that they  had arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which the  deceased owed when he died. The prince replied that it was a pity  creditors should be so cruel, and said: &quot;Go bury the dead, and let his  creditors come to my lodging, and there their debts shall be paid.&quot;  They came, in such great numbers that before night he had only  twopence left for himself.
          Now Jack the Giant-Killer, coming that way, was so taken with the  generosity of the prince, that he desired to be his servant. This  being agreed upon, the next morning they set forward on their journey  together, when, as they were riding out of the town, an old woman  called after the prince, saying, &quot;He has owed me twopence these seven  years; pray pay me as well as the rest.&quot; Putting his hand to his  pocket, the prince gave the woman all he had left, so that after their  day's food, which cost what small spell Jack had by him, they were  without a penny between them.
          When the sun got low, the king's son said: &quot;Jack, since we have no  money, where can we lodge this night?&quot;
          But Jack replied: &quot;Master, we'll do well enough, for I have an uncle  lives within two miles of this place; he is a huge and monstrous giant  with three heads; he'll fight five hundred men in armour, and make  them to fly before him.&quot; &quot;Alas!&quot; quoth the prince, &quot;what shall we do  there? He'll certainly chop us up at a mouthful. Nay, we are scarce  enough to fill one of his hollow teeth!&quot;
          &quot;It is no matter for that,&quot; quoth Jack; &quot;I myself will go before and  prepare the way for you; therefore stop here and wait till I return.&quot;  Jack then rode away at full speed, and coming to the gate of the  castle, he knocked so loud that he made the neighbouring hills  resound. The giant roared out at this like thunder: &quot;Who's there?&quot;
          Jack answered: &quot;None but your poor cousin Jack.&quot;
          Quoth he: &quot;What news with my poor cousin Jack?&quot;
          He replied: &quot;Dear uncle, heavy news, God wot!&quot;
          &quot;Prithee,&quot; quoth the giant, &quot;what heavy news can come to me? I am a  giant with three heads, and besides thou knowest I can fight five  hundred men in armour, and make them fly like chaff before the wind.&quot;
          &quot;Oh, but,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;here's the king's son a-coming with a thousand  men in armour to kill you and destroy all that you have!&quot;
          &quot;Oh, cousin Jack,&quot; said the giant, &quot;this is heavy news indeed! I will  immediately run and hide myself, and thou shalt lock, bolt, and bar me  in, and keep the keys until the prince is gone.&quot; Having secured the  giant, Jack fetched his master, when they made themselves heartily  merry whilst the poor giant lay trembling in a vault under the ground.
          Early in the morning Jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of  gold and silver, and then sent him three miles forward on his journey,  at which time the prince was pretty well out of the smell of the  giant. Jack then returned, and let the giant out of the vault, who  asked what he should give him for keeping the castle from destruction.  &quot;Why,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;I want nothing but the old coat and cap, together  with the old rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed's head.&quot;  Quoth the giant: &quot;You know not what you ask; they are the most  precious things I have. The coat will keep you invisible, the cap will  tell you all you want to know, the sword cuts asunder whatever you  strike, and the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness. But you have  been very serviceable to me, therefore take them with all my heart.&quot;  Jack thanked his uncle, and then went off with them. He soon overtook  his master and they quickly arrived at the house of the lady the  prince sought, who, finding the prince to be a suitor, prepared a  splendid banquet for him. After the repast was concluded, she told him  she had a task for him. She wiped his mouth with a handkerchief,  saying: &quot;You must show me that handkerchief to-morrow morning, or else  you will lose your head.&quot; With that she put it in her bosom. The  prince went to bed in great sorrow, but Jack's cap of knowledge  informed him how it was to be obtained. In the middle of the night she  called upon her familiar spirit to carry her to Lucifer. But Jack put  on his coat of darkness and his shoes of swiftness, and was there as  soon as she was. When she entered the place of the Old One, she gave  the handkerchief to old Lucifer, who laid it upon a shelf, whence Jack  took it and brought it to his master, who showed it to the lady next  day, and so saved his life. On that day, she gave the prince a kiss  and told him he must show her the lips to-morrow morning that she  kissed last night, or lose his head.
          &quot;Ah!&quot; he replied, &quot;if you kiss none but mine, I will.&quot;
          &quot;That is neither here nor there,&quot; said she; &quot;if you do not, death's  your portion!&quot;
          At midnight she went as before, and was angry with old Lucifer for  letting the handkerchief go. &quot;But now,&quot; quoth she, &quot;I will be too hard  for the king's son, for I will kiss thee, and he is to show me thy  lips.&quot; Which she did, and Jack, when she was not standing by, cut off  Lucifer's head and brought it under his invisible coat to his master,  who the next morning pulled it out by the horns before the lady. This  broke the enchantment and the evil spirit left her, and she appeared  in all her beauty. They were married the next morning, and soon after  went to the court of King Arthur, where Jack for his many great  exploits, was made one of the Knights of the Round Table.
          Jack soon went searching for giants again, but he had not ridden far,  when he saw a cave, near the entrance of which he beheld a giant  sitting upon a block of timber, with a knotted iron club by his side.  His goggle eyes were like flames of fire, his countenance grim and  ugly, and his cheeks like a couple of large flitches of bacon, while  the bristles of his beard resembled rods of iron wire, and the locks  that hung down upon his brawny shoulders were like curled snakes or  hissing adders. Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on the coat  of darkness, went up close to the giant, and said softly: &quot;Oh! are you  there? It will not be long before I take you fast by the beard.&quot; The  giant all this while could not see him, on account of his invisible  coat, so that Jack, coming up close to the monster, struck a blow with  his sword at his head, but, missing his aim, he cut off the nose  instead. At this, the giant roared like claps of thunder, and began to  lay about him with his iron club like one stark mad. But Jack, running  behind, drove his sword up to the hilt in the giant's back, so that he  fell down dead. This done, Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent it,  with his brother's also, to King Arthur, by a waggoner he hired for  that purpose.
          Jack now resolved to enter the giant's cave in search of his treasure,  and, passing along through a great many windings and turnings, he came  at length to a large room paved with freestone, at the upper end of  which was a boiling caldron, and on the right hand a large table, at  which the giant used to dine. Then he came to a window, barred with  iron, through which he looked and beheld a vast number of miserable  captives, who, seeing him, cried out: &quot;Alas! young man, art thou come  to be one amongst us in this miserable den?&quot;
          &quot;Ay,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;but pray tell me what is the meaning of your  captivity?&quot;
          &quot;We are kept here,&quot; said one, &quot;till such time as the giants have a  wish to feast, and then the fattest among us is slaughtered! And many  are the times they have dined upon murdered men!&quot;
          &quot;Say you so,&quot; quoth Jack, and straightway unlocked the gate and let  them free, who all rejoiced like condemned men at sight of a pardon.  Then searching the giant's coffers, he shared the gold and silver  equally amongst them and took them to a neighbouring castle, where  they all feasted and made merry over their deliverance.
          But in the midst of all this mirth a messenger brought news that one  Thunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his  kinsmen, had come from the northern dales to be revenged on Jack, and  was within a mile of the castle, the country people flying before him  like chaff. But Jack was not a bit daunted, and said: &quot;Let him come! I  have a tool to pick his teeth; and you, ladies and gentlemen, walk out  into the garden, and you shall witness this giant Thunderdell's death  and destruction.&quot;
          The castle was situated in the midst of a small island surrounded by a  moat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide, over which lay a  drawbridge. So Jack employed men to cut through this bridge on both  sides, nearly to the middle; and then, dressing himself in his  invisible coat, he marched against the giant with his sword of  sharpness. Although the giant could not see Jack, he smelt his  approach, and cried out in these words:
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fee, fi, fo, fum!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;I smell the blood of an Englishman!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Be he alive or be he dead,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll grind his bones to make me bread!&quot;
          
          &quot;Say'st thou so,&quot; said Jack; &quot;then thou art a monstrous miller  indeed.&quot;
          The giant cried out again: &quot;Art thou that villain who killed my  kinsmen? Then I will tear thee with my teeth, suck thy blood, and  grind thy bones to powder.&quot;
          &quot;You'll have to catch me first,&quot; quoth Jack, and throwing off his  invisible coat, so that the giant might see him, and putting on his  shoes of swiftness, he ran from the giant, who followed like a walking  castle, so that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at  every step. Jack led him a long dance, in order that the gentlemen and  ladies might see; and at last to end the matter, ran lightly over the  drawbridge, the giant, in full speed, pursuing him with his club.  Then, coming to the middle of the bridge, the giant's great weight  broke it down, and he tumbled headlong into the water, where he rolled  and wallowed like a whale. Jack, standing by the moat, laughed at him  all the while; but though the giant foamed to hear him scoff, and  plunged from place to place in the moat, yet he could not get out to  be revenged. Jack at length got a cart-rope and cast it over the two  heads of the giant, and drew him ashore by a team of horses, and then  cut off both his heads with his sword of sharpness, and sent them to  King Arthur.
          After some time spent in mirth and pastime, Jack, taking leave of the  knights and ladies, set out for new adventures. Through many woods he  passed, and came at length to the foot of a high mountain. Here, late  at night, he found a lonesome house, and knocked at the door, which  was opened by an aged man with a head as white as snow. &quot;Father,&quot; said  Jack, &quot;can you lodge a benighted traveller that has lost his way?&quot;  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the old man; &quot;you are right welcome to my poor cottage.&quot;  Whereupon Jack entered, and down they sat together, and the old man  began to speak as follows: &quot;Son, I see by your belt you are the great  conqueror of giants, and behold, my son, on the top of this mountain  is an enchanted castle, this is kept by a giant named Galligantua, and  he by the help of an old conjurer, betrays many knights and ladies  into his castle, where by magic art they are transformed into sundry  shapes and forms. But above all, I grieve for a duke's daughter, whom  they fetched from her father's garden, carrying her through the air in  a burning chariot drawn by fiery dragons, when they secured her within  the castle, and transformed her into a white hind. And though many  knights have tried to break the enchantment, and work her deliverance,  yet no one could accomplish it, on account of two dreadful griffins  which are placed at the castle gate and which destroy every one who  comes near. But you, my son, may pass by them undiscovered, where on  the gates of the castle you will find engraven in large letters how  the spell may be broken.&quot; Jack gave the old man his hand, and promised  that in the morning he would venture his life to free the lady.
          In the morning Jack arose and put on his invisible coat and magic cap  and shoes, and prepared himself for the fray. Now, when he had reached  the top of the mountain he soon discovered the two fiery griffins, but  passed them without fear, because of his invisible coat. When he had  got beyond them, he found upon the gates of the castle a golden  trumpet hung by a silver chain, under which these lines were engraved:
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoever shall this trumpet blow,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Shall soon the giant overthrow,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And break the black enchantment straight;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;So all shall be in happy state.&quot;
          
          Jack had no sooner read this but he blew the trumpet, at which the  castle trembled to its vast foundations, and the giant and conjurer  were in horrid confusion, biting their thumbs and tearing their hair,  knowing their wicked reign was at an end. Then the giant stooping to  take up his club, Jack at one blow cut off his head; whereupon the  conjurer, mounting up into the air, was carried away in a whirlwind.  Then the enchantment was broken, and all the lords and ladies who had  so long been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their  proper shapes, and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke. This  being done, the head of Galligantua was likewise, in the usual manner,  conveyed to the Court of King Arthur, where, the very next day, Jack  followed, with the knights and ladies who had been delivered.  Whereupon, as a reward for his good services, the king prevailed upon  the duke to bestow his daughter in marriage on honest Jack. So married  they were, and the whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding.  Furthermore, the king bestowed on Jack a noble castle, with a very  beautiful estate thereto belonging, where he and his lady lived in  great joy and happiness all the rest of their days.
