          One day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the cornyard when&mdash;whack!&mdash;  something hit her upon the head. &quot;Goodness gracious me!&quot; said Henny-  penny; &quot;the sky's a-going to fall; I must go and tell the king.&quot;
          So she went along and she went along and she went along till she met  Cocky-locky. &quot;Where are you going, Henny-penny?&quot; says Cocky-locky.  &quot;Oh! I'm going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,&quot; says Henny-  penny. &quot;May I come with you?&quot; says Cocky-locky. &quot;Certainly,&quot; says  Henny-penny. So Henny-penny and Cocky-locky went to tell-the king the  sky was falling.
          They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they  met Ducky-daddles. &quot;Where are you going to, Henny-penny and Cocky-  locky?&quot; says Ducky-daddles. &quot;Oh! we're going to tell the king the  sky's a-falling,&quot; said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. &quot;May I come with  you?&quot; says Ducky-daddles. &quot;Certainly,&quot; said Henny-penny and Cocky-  locky. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles went to tell the  king the sky was a-falling.
          So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till  they met Goosey-poosey, &quot;Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky-  locky and Ducky-daddles?&quot; said Goosey-poosey. &quot;Oh! we're going to  tell the king the sky's a-falling,&quot; said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky  and Ducky-daddles. &quot;May I come with you,&quot; said Goosey-poosey.  &quot;Certainly,&quot; said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles. So  Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey went to tell  the king the sky was a-falling.
          So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till  they met Turkey-lurkey. &quot;Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-  locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?&quot; says Turkey-lurkey. &quot;Oh!  we're going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,&quot; said Henny-penny,  Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey. &quot;May I come with you?  Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey?&quot; said  Turkey-lurkey. &quot;Why, certainly, Turkey-lurkey,&quot; said Henny-penny,  Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-  locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey all went to tell  the king the sky was a-falling.
          So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till  they met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,  Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey: &quot;Where are you going,  Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-  lurkey?&quot; And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,  and Turkey-lurkey said to Foxy-woxy: &quot;We're going to tell the king the  sky's a-falling.&quot; &quot;Oh! but this is not the way to the king, Henny-  penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey,&quot;  says Foxy-woxy; &quot;I know the proper way; shall I show it you?&quot; &quot;Why  certainly, Foxy-woxy,&quot; said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,  Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-  daddles, Goosey-poosey, Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy all went to tell  the king the sky was a-falling. So they went along, and they went  along, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and dark hole.  Now this was the door of Foxy-woxy's cave. But Foxy-woxy said to  Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-  lurkey: &quot;This is the short way to the king's palace you'll soon get  there if you follow me. I will go first and you come after, Henny-  penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.&quot;  &quot;Why of course, certainly, without doubt, why not?&quot; said Henny-Penny,  Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.
          So Foxy-woxy went into his cave, and he didn't go very far but turned  round to wait for Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-  poosey and Turkey-lurkey. So at last at first Turkey-lurkey went  through the dark hole into the cave. He hadn't got far when &quot;Hrumph,&quot;  Foxy-woxy snapped off Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his body over his  left shoulder. Then Goosey-poosey went in, and &quot;Hrumph,&quot; off went her  head and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey. Then Ducky-  daddles waddled down, and &quot;Hrumph,&quot; snapped Foxy-woxy, and Ducky-  daddles' head was off and Ducky-daddles was thrown alongside Turkey-  lurkey and Goosey-poosey. Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the cave  and he hadn't gone far when &quot;Snap, Hrumph!&quot; went Foxy-woxy and Cocky-  locky was thrown alongside of Turkey-lurkey, Goosey-poosey and Ducky-  daddles.
          But Foxy-woxy had made two bites at Cocky-locky, and when the first  snap only hurt Cocky-locky, but didn't kill him, he called out to  Henny-penny. So she turned tail and ran back home, so she never told  the king the sky was a-falling.
