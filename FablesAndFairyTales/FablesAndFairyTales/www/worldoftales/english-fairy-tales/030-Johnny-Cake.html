          Once upon a time there was an old man, and an old woman, and a little  boy. One morning the old woman made a Johnny-cake, and put it in the  oven to bake. &quot;You watch the Johnny-cake while your father and I go  out to work in the garden.&quot; So the old man and the old woman went out  and began to hoe potatoes, and left the little boy to tend the oven.  But he didn't watch it all the time, and all of a sudden he heard a  noise, and he looked up and the oven door popped open, and out of the  oven jumped Johnny-cake, and went rolling along end over end, towards  the open door of the house. The little boy ran to shut the door, but  Johnny-cake was too quick for him and rolled through the door, down  the steps, and out into the road long before the little boy could  catch him. The little boy ran after him as fast as he could clip it,  crying out to his father and mother, who heard the uproar, and threw  down their hoes and gave chase too. But Johnny-cake outran all three a  long way, and was soon out of sight, while they had to sit down, all  out of breath, on a bank to rest.
          On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two well-diggers who  looked up from their work and called out: &quot;Where ye going, Johnny-  cake?&quot;
          He said: &quot;I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,  and I can outrun you too-o-o!&quot;
          &quot;Ye can, can ye? we'll see about that?&quot; said they; and they threw down  their picks and ran after him, but couldn't catch up with him, and  soon they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.
          On ran Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two ditch-diggers who  were digging a ditch. &quot;Where ye going, Johnny-cake?&quot; said they. He  said: &quot;I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy, and  two well-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!&quot;
          &quot;Ye can, can ye? we'll see about that!&quot; said they; and they threw down  their spades, and ran after him too. But Johnny-cake soon outstripped  them also, and seeing they could never catch him, they gave up the  chase and sat down to rest.
          On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a bear. The bear said:
  &quot;Where are ye going, Johnny-cake?&quot;
          
          He said: &quot;I've outrun an old man, and an old woman and a little boy,  and two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, and I can outrun you too-  o-o!&quot;
          &quot;Ye can, can ye?&quot; growled the bear, &quot;we'll see about that!&quot; and  trotted as fast as his legs could carry him after Johnny-cake, who  never stopped to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far  behind that he saw he might as well give up the hunt first as last, so  he stretched himself out by the roadside to rest.
          On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a wolf. The wolf said:&mdash;  &quot;Where ye going, Johnny-cake?&quot; He said: &quot;I've outrun an old man, and  an old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two ditch-  diggers and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!&quot;
          &quot;Ye can, can ye?&quot; snarled the wolf, &quot;we'll see about that!&quot; And he set  into a gallop after Johnny-cake, who went on and on so fast that the  wolf too saw there was no hope of overtaking him, and he too lay down  to rest.
          On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly  in a corner of the fence. The fox called out in a sharp voice, but  without getting up: &quot;Where ye going Johnny-cake?&quot;
          He said: &quot;I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,  and two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I  can outrun you too-o-o!&quot;
          The fox said: &quot;I can't quite hear you, Johnny-cake, won't you come a  little closer?&quot; turning his head a little to one side.
          Johnny-cake stopped his race for the first time, and went a little  closer, and called out in a very loud voice &quot;I've outrun an old  man, and an old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two  ditch-diggers, and a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-  o.&quot;
          &quot;Can't quite hear you; won't you come a little closer?&quot; said  the fox in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards  Johnny-cake, and put one paw behind his ear.
          Johnny-cake came up close, and leaning towards the fox screamed out:
            I'VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AND AN OLD WOMAN, AND A LITTLE BOY, AND TWO
            WELL-DIGGERS, AND TWO DITCH-DIGGERS, AND A BEAR, AND A WOLF, AND I CAN
            OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!&quot;
          
          &quot;You can, can you?&quot; yelped the fox, and he snapped up the Johnny-cake  in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.
