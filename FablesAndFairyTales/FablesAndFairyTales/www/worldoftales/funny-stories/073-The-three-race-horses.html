Three racehorses were standing in a stable bragging to each other one day.
The first horse boasts "I've been in 59 races and I've won 35 of them." "That's nothing," says the second horse. "I've raced 97 times, and I've won 78 of them!"
The third horse joins in: "Well, I've raced 122 times and I've won 102!"
Just then, the horses hear a voice say, "I've got you all beat!"
The horses look down and sees a greyhound.
"I've raced over 200 times, and I have NEVER lost!" The horses look at the dog in amazement. One of them says "How about that! A talking dog!"
