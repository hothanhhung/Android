One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God...
&nbsp; "Lord, I have a problem!"
&nbsp; "What's the problem, Eve?"
&nbsp; "Lord, I know you've created me and have provided this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, and that hilarious comedic snake, but I'm just not happy."
&nbsp; "Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.
&nbsp; "Lord, I am lonely. And I'm sick to death of apples."
&nbsp; "Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you.
"&nbsp; "What's a 'man,' Lord?"
&nbsp; "This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits.&nbsp; He'll lie, cheat, and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. But, he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things.&nbsp; He will look silly aroused, but since you've being complaining, I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your... ah, physical needs.&nbsp; He'll be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about.&nbsp; He won't be too smart, so he'll also need your advise to think properly."
&nbsp; "Sounds great," says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. "What's the catch, Lord?"
&nbsp; "Yeah, well.... you can have him on one condition."
&nbsp; "What's that, Lord?"
&nbsp; "As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring...So you'll have to let him believe that I made him first...So, just remember... it's our secret...Woman-to-woman!"
