An atheist was spending a quiet day fishing when suddenly his boat was attacked by the Loch Ness monster. In one easy flip, the beast tossed him and his boat at least a hundred feet into the air. The monster then opened its mouth while waiting below to swallow man and boat.&nbsp; As the man sailed head over heels and started to fall towards the open jaws of the ferocious beast he cried out, "Oh, my God! Help me!"
&nbsp; Suddenly, the scene froze in place. As the atheist hung in midair, a booming voice came out of the clouds and said, "I thought you didn't believe in Me!"
"God, come on, give me a break!" the man pleaded, "Just seconds ago I didn't believe in the Loch Ness monster either!"&nbsp; 
"Well," said God, "now that you are a believer you must understand that I won't work miracles to snatch you from certain death in the jaws of the monster, but I can change hearts. What would you have me do?"&nbsp; 
The atheist thinks for a minute and then says, "God, please have the Loch Ness Monster believe in You also." 
God replies, "So be it."&nbsp; 
The scene starts in motion again with the atheist falling towards the ravenous jaws of the ferocious beast.&nbsp; Then the Loch Ness Monster folds his claws together and says, "Lord, bless this food You have so graciously provided....."
