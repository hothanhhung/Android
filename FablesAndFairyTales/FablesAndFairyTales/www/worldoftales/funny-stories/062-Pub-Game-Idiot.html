Last Boxing Day (that's the day after Xmas for those who don't have one) I was in a local bar with three of my friends.  I don't smoke myself, but the others all did and one of them, Porky, showed us this bar game.  You take a box of matches and pierce the top of it with one unlit match, so that this match sticks vertically up out of the top (i.e. the only side that doesn't have contact with the drawer underneath so that it can still open and close).  The challange is to take the box in your hand and with just that one hand open the box, take out a match, light it and then light the match on top with the match you have just struck.

Turned out the hardest bit was getting the match struck with enough force to ignite it but not so much that it carries on and you burn yourself in the palm of the hand (try it and you'll see what I mean!).  So me, Porky and one of the other guys had been sitting trying this for about fifteen minutes but mostly kept burning ourselves.  Then Toomba, the guy who up to this point had just been watching, decided he would have a go.  We were happy to sit back and nurse our burns while he took a blast at it.  So, he takes the box in his hand and pokes it open with a finger.  He then takes a match out WITH HIS OTHER HAND and procedes to do it and then gloat at his "success" assuming our astonished faces were because his genius brain had cracked it - ignore the "do it with one hand" bit!
