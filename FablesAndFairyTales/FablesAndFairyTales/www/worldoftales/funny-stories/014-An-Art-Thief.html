Recently a guy in Paris nearly got away with stealing several paintings from the Louvre. However, after planning the crime,  getting in and out past security, he was captured only 2 blocks away  when his Econoline ran out of gas. 

When asked how he could mastermind such a crime and then make such an obvious error, he replied:


(brace yourself)


(this is going to hurt.)


(really bad.)


"I had no Monet to buy Degas to make the Van Gogh."
