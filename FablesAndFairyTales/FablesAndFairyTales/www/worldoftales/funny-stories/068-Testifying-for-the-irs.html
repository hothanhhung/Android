"A woman, about to be married, asked her mother what to wear on her wedding night. She replied suggesting that her daughter wear a heavy, long, flannel nightgown that goes right up to her neck.

The man protested: "Rabbi, what does all this have to do with my problem with the IRS?"  "No matter what you wear, you are going to get screwed.
