A young couple decided to wed.&nbsp; As the big day approached, they grew apprehensive.&nbsp; Each had a problem they had never before shared with anyone, not even each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Groom-to-be, overcoming his fear, decided to ask his father for advice. "Father," he said, "I am deeply concerned about the success of my marriage.&nbsp; I love my finance, very much, but you see, I have very smelly feet, and I'm afraid that my future wife will be put off by them."&nbsp; "No problem," said dad, "all you have to do is wash your feet as often as possible, and always wear socks, even to bed."&nbsp; Well, to him this seemed a workable solution. The bride-to-be, overcoming her fear, decided to take her problem up her mom.&nbsp; "Mom," she said, "When I wake up in the morning my breath is truly awful."&nbsp; "Honey," her mother consoled, "everyone has bad breath in the morning."&nbsp; "No, you don't understand.&nbsp; My morning breath is so bad, I'm afraid&nbsp; that my new husband will not want to sleep in the same room with me." Her mother said simply, "Try this.&nbsp; In the morning, get straight out of bed, and head for the bathroom and brush your teeth.&nbsp; The key is, not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth.&nbsp; Not a word," her mother affirmed.&nbsp; Well, she thought it was certainly worth a try.&nbsp; The loving couple were finally married in a beautiful ceremony.&nbsp; Not forgetting the advice each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning silence, they managed quite well.&nbsp; That is, until about six months later.&nbsp; Shortly before dawn, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of his socks had come off.&nbsp; Fearful of the consequences, he frantically searches the bed.&nbsp; This, of course, woke his bride and without thinking, she immediately asks, "What on earth are you doing?"&nbsp; "Oh, no!" he gasped in shock, "You've swallowed my sock!"
