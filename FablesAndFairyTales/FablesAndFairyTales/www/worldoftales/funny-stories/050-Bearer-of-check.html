My wife got a check from a survey company for filling out a couple of surveys about consumer products, etc.&nbsp; Anyway, the checks are made out to &quot;bearer&quot; because they don't want to give cash.&nbsp; Well, when my wife goes to the bank to cash the check, her conversation with the teller goes&nbsp; something like this:&nbsp;

Teller: I can't cash this check, it's not made out to you. Wife: I know, It's made out to the BEARER.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Teller: Right. So I can't cash it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wife: I AM the bearer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Teller: Your name is Donna ***.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Irritated wife: The check is made out to the bearer, I am the bearer of the check.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Teller: Is this **to** a company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wife: **Sigh** NO. It is **from** a company, made out to the **BEARER** of the check which is ME.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Teller: Let me go talk to my manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So the MANAGER comes over and says: Ma'am, we can't cash this check, it doesn't have your name on it.&nbsp; So my wife goes into extreme detail about how she got the check, why her name wasn't on the check, and finally says:&nbsp; 
Wife: Why don't you go find a dictionary and look up the word Bearer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So the Manager leaves, is gone for a good 10 minutes and finally whispers to the teller to go ahead and cash the check... And they say that customer service doesn't exist anymore.&nbsp; Sheesh!
