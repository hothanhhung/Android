The Swallow and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage.
Said the Swallow: "Just look at my bright and downy feathers. Your black stiff quills are not worth having. Why don't you dress better? Show a little pride!"
"Your feathers may do very well in spring," replied the Crow, "butâ€”I don't remember ever having seen you around in winter, and that's when I enjoy myself most."

 <i>"Friends in fine weather only, are not worth much."</i>
