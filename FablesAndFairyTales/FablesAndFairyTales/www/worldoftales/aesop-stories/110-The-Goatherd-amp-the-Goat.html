A Goat strayed away from the flock, tempted by a patch of clover. The Goatherd tried to call it back, but in vain. It would not obey him. Then he picked up a stone and threw it, breaking the Goat's horn.
The Goatherd was frightened.
"Do not tell the master," he begged the Goat.
"No," said the Goat, "that broken horn can speak for itself!"

 <i>"Wicked deeds will not stay hid."</i>
