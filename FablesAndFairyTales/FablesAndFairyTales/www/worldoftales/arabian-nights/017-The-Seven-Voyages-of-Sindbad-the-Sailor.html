           In the times of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in Bagdad a  poor porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day was sent to carry a  heavy load from one end of the city to the other.  Before he had  accomplished half the distance he was so tired that, finding himself in  a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled with rose water, and a  cool breeze was blowing, he set his burden upon the ground, and sat  down to rest in the shade of a grand house.  Very soon he decided that  he could not have chosen a pleasanter place; a delicious perfume of  aloes wood and pastilles came from the open windows and mingled with  the scent of the rose water which steamed up from the hot pavement.  Within the palace he heard some music, as of many instruments cunningly  played, and the melodious warble of nightingales and other birds, and  by this, and the appetising smell of many dainty dishes of which he  presently became aware, he judged that feasting and merry making were  going on.  He wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he had  never seen before, the street in which it stood being one which he  seldom had occasion to pass.  To satisfy his curiosity he went up to  some splendidly dressed servants who stood at the door, and asked one  of them the name of the master of the mansion. 
           &quot;What,&quot; replied he, &quot;do you live in Bagdad, and not know that here  lives the noble Sindbad the Sailor, that famous traveller who sailed  over every sea upon which the sun shines?&quot; 
           The porter, who had often heard people speak of the immense wealth of  Sindbad, could not help feeling envious of one whose lot seemed to be  as happy as his own was miserable.  Casting his eyes up to the sky he  exclaimed aloud, 
           &quot;Consider, Mighty Creator of all things, the differences between  Sindbad's life and mine.  Every day I suffer a thousand hardships and  misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barley bread to  keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbad spends money  right and left and lives upon the fat of the land!  What has he done  that you should give him this pleasant life--what have I done to  deserve so hard a fate?&quot; 
           So saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself with  misery and despair.  Just at this moment a servant came out of the  palace, and taking him by the arm said, &quot;Come with me, the noble  Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you.&quot; 
           Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons, and feared that his  unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad,  so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave  the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street.  However the  lackey promised him that it should be taken care of, and urged him to  obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to  yield. 
           He followed the servant into a vast room, where a great company was  seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies.  In the  place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long white beard gave him a  venerable air.  Behind his chair stood a crowd of attendants eager to  minister to his wants.  This was the famous Sindbad himself.  The  porter, more than ever alarmed at the sight of so much magnificence,  tremblingly saluted the noble company.  Sindbad, making a sign to him  to approach, caused him to be seated at his right hand, and himself  heaped choice morsels upon his plate, and poured out for him a draught  of excellent wine, and presently, when the banquet drew to a close,  spoke to him familiarly, asking his name and occupation. 
           &quot;My lord,&quot; replied the porter, &quot;I am called Hindbad.&quot; 
           &quot;I am glad to see you here,&quot; continued Sindbad.  &quot;And I will answer for  the rest of the company that they are equally pleased, but I wish you  to tell me what it was that you said just now in the street.&quot; For  Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast began, had heard  his complaint and therefore had sent for him. 
           At this question Hindbad was covered with confusion, and hanging down  his head, replied, &quot;My lord, I confess that, overcome by weariness and  ill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray you to pardon me.&quot; 
           &quot;Oh!&quot; replied Sindbad, &quot;do not imagine that I am so unjust as to blame  you.  On the contrary, I understand your situation and can pity you.  Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right.  You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the wealth and luxury  that you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger, but this is far  indeed from being the case.  I have only reached this happy state after  having for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger. 
           &quot;Yes, my noble friends,&quot; he continued, addressing the company, &quot;I  assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter even  the most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the seas.  Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my seven  voyages, and the dangers and wonders that I have met with by sea and  land, I will now give you a full and true account of them, which I  think you will be well pleased to hear.&quot; 
           As Sindbad was relating his adventures chiefly on account of the  porter, he ordered, before beginning his tale, that the burden which  had been left in the street should be carried by some of his own  servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at first, while he  remained to listen to the story.
