           It must be a marvel to you how, after having five times met with  shipwreck and unheard of perils, I could again tempt fortune and risk  fresh trouble.  I am even surprised myself when I look back, but  evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of repose I prepared  to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreaties of my friends and  relations, who did all they could to keep me at home.  Instead of going  by the Persian Gulf, I travelled a considerable way overland, and  finally embarked from a distant Indian port with a captain who meant to  make a long voyage.  And truly he did so, for we fell in with stormy  weather which drove us completely out of our course, so that for many  days neither captain nor pilot knew where we were, nor where we were  going.  When they did at last discover our position we had small ground  for rejoicing, for the captain, casting his turban upon the deck and  tearing his beard, declared that we were in the most dangerous spot  upon the whole wide sea, and had been caught by a current which was at  that minute sweeping us to destruction.  It was too true!  In spite of  all the sailors could do we were driven with frightful rapidity towards  the foot of a mountain, which rose sheer out of the sea, and our vessel  was dashed to pieces upon the rocks at its base, not, however, until we  had managed to scramble on shore, carrying with us the most precious of  our possessions.  When we had done this the captain said to us: 
           &quot;Now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once, since  from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever returned.&quot; 
           This speech discouraged us much, and we began to lament over our sad  fate. 
           The mountain formed the seaward boundary of a large island, and the  narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewn with the  wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bones of the luckless  mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we shuddered to think how  soon our own would be added to the heap.  All around, too, lay vast  quantities of the costliest merchandise, and treasures were heaped in  every cranny of the rocks, but all these things only added to the  desolation of the scene.  It struck me as a very strange thing that a  river of clear fresh water, which gushed out from the mountain not far  from where we stood, instead of flowing into the sea as rivers  generally do, turned off sharply, and flowed out of sight under a  natural archway of rock, and when I went to examine it more closely I  found that inside the cave the walls were thick with diamonds, and  rubies, and masses of crystal, and the floor was strewn with ambergris.  Here, then, upon this desolate shore we abandoned ourselves to our  fate, for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain, and if a  ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom.  The first thing  our captain did was to divide equally amongst us all the food we  possessed, and then the length of each man's life depended on the time  he could make his portion last.  I myself could live upon very little. 
           Nevertheless, by the time I had buried the last of my companions my  stock of provisions was so small that I hardly thought I should live  long enough to dig my own grave, which I set about doing, while I  regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was always bringing me  into such straits, and thought longingly of all the comfort and luxury  that I had left.  But luckily for me the fancy took me to stand once  more beside the river where it plunged out of sight in the depths of  the cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me.  This river which hid  itself underground doubtless emerged again at some distant spot.  Why  should I not build a raft and trust myself to its swiftly flowing  waters?  If I perished before I could reach the light of day once more  I should be no worse off than I was now, for death stared me in the  face, while there was always the possibility that, as I was born under  a lucky star, I might find myself safe and sound in some desirable  land.  I decided at any rate to risk it, and speedily built myself a  stout raft of drift-wood with strong cords, of which enough and to  spare lay strewn upon the beach.  I then made up many packages of  rubies, emeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and  bound them upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and  then I seated myself upon it, having two small oars that I had  fashioned laid ready to my hand, and loosed the cord which held it to  the bank.  Once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the  gloomy archway, and I found myself in total darkness, carried smoothly  forward by the rapid river.  On I went as it seemed to me for many  nights and days.  Once the channel became so small that I had a narrow  escape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that I took  the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales.  Though I only ate  what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive, the inevitable  moment came when, after swallowing my last morsel of food, I began to  wonder if I must after all die of hunger.  Then, worn out with anxiety  and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep, and when I again opened my eyes  I was once more in the light of day; a beautiful country lay before me,  and my raft, which was tied to the river bank, was surrounded by  friendly looking black men.  I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to  me in return, but I could not understand a word of their language.  Feeling perfectly bewildered by my sudden return to life and light, I  murmured to myself in Arabic, &quot;Close thine eyes, and while thou  sleepest Heaven will change thy fortune from evil to good.&quot; 
           One of the natives, who understood this tongue, then came forward  saying: 
           &quot;My brother, be not surprised to see us; this is our land, and as we  came to get water from the river we noticed your raft floating down it,  and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore.  We have waited  for your awakening; tell us now whence you come and where you were  going by that dangerous way?&quot; 
           I replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them, but  that I was starving, and would fain eat something first.  I was soon  supplied with all I needed, and having satisfied my hunger I told them  faithfully all that had befallen me.  They were lost in wonder at my  tale when it was interpreted to them, and said that adventures so  surprising must be related to their king only by the man to whom they  had happened.  So, procuring a horse, they mounted me upon it, and we  set out, followed by several strong men carrying my raft just as it was  upon their shoulders.  In this order we marched into the city of  Serendib, where the natives presented me to their king, whom I saluted  in the Indian fashion, prostrating myself at his feet and kissing the  ground; but the monarch bade me rise and sit beside him, asking first  what was my name. 
           &quot;I am Sindbad,&quot; I replied, &quot;whom men call `the Sailor,' for I have  voyaged much upon many seas.&quot; 
           &quot;And how come you here?&quot; asked the king. 
           I told my story, concealing nothing, and his surprise and delight were  so great that he ordered my adventures to be written in letters of gold  and laid up in the archives of his kingdom. 
           Presently my raft was brought in and the bales opened in his presence,  and the king declared that in all his treasury there were no such  rubies and emeralds as those which lay in great heaps before him.  Seeing that he looked at them with interest, I ventured to say that I  myself and all that I had were at his disposal, but he answered me  smiling: 
           &quot;Nay, Sindbad.  Heaven forbid that I should covet your riches; I will  rather add to them, for I desire that you shall not leave my kingdom  without some tokens of my good will.&quot;  He then commanded his officers  to provide me with a suitable lodging at his expense, and sent slaves  to wait upon me and carry my raft and my bales to my new dwelling  place.  You may imagine that I praised his generosity and gave him  grateful thanks, nor did I fail to present myself daily in his audience  chamber, and for the rest of my time I amused myself in seeing all that  was most worthy of attention in the city.  The island of Serendib being  situated on the equinoctial line, the days and nights there are of  equal length.  The chief city is placed at the end of a beautiful  valley, formed by the highest mountain in the world, which is in the  middle of the island.  I had the curiosity to ascend to its very  summit, for this was the place to which Adam was banished out of  Paradise.  Here are found rubies and many precious things, and rare  plants grow abundantly, with cedar trees and cocoa palms.  On the  seashore and at the mouths of the rivers the divers seek for pearls,  and in some valleys diamonds are plentiful.  After many days I  petitioned the king that I might return to my own country, to which he  graciously consented.  Moreover, he loaded me with rich gifts, and when  I went to take leave of him he entrusted me with a royal present and a  letter to the Commander of the Faithful, our sovereign lord, saying, &quot;I  pray you give these to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid, and assure him of  my friendship.&quot; 
           I accepted the charge respectfully, and soon embarked upon the vessel  which the king himself had chosen for me.  The king's letter was  written in blue characters upon a rare and precious skin of yellowish  colour, and these were the words of it: &quot;The King of the Indies, before  whom walk a thousand elephants, who lives in a palace, of which the  roof blazes with a hundred thousand rubies, and whose treasure house  contains twenty thousand diamond crowns, to the Caliph Haroun al  Raschid sends greeting.  Though the offering we present to you is  unworthy of your notice, we pray you to accept it as a mark of the  esteem and friendship which we cherish for you, and of which we gladly  send you this token, and we ask of you a like regard if you deem us  worthy of it.  Adieu, brother.&quot; 
           The present consisted of a vase carved from a single ruby, six inches  high and as thick as my finger; this was filled with the choicest  pearls, large, and of perfect shape and lustre; secondly, a huge snake  skin, with scales as large as a sequin, which would preserve from  sickness those who slept upon it.  Then quantities of aloes wood,  camphor, and pistachio-nuts; and lastly, a beautiful slave girl, whose  robes glittered with precious stones. 
           After a long and prosperous voyage we landed at Balsora, and I made  haste to reach Bagdad, and taking the king's letter I presented myself  at the palace gate, followed by the beautiful slave, and various  members of my own family, bearing the treasure. 
           As soon as I had declared my errand I was conducted into the presence  of the Caliph, to whom, after I had made my obeisance, I gave the  letter and the king's gift, and when he had examined them he demanded  of me whether the Prince of Serendib was really as rich and powerful as  he claimed to be. 
           &quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; I replied, again bowing humbly before him,  &quot;I can assure your Majesty that he has in no way exaggerated his wealth  and grandeur.  Nothing can equal the magnificence of his palace.  When  he goes abroad his throne is prepared upon the back of an elephant, and  on either side of him ride his ministers, his favourites, and  courtiers.  On his elephant's neck sits an officer, his golden lance in  his hand, and behind him stands another bearing a pillar of gold, at  the top of which is an emerald as long as my hand.  A thousand men in  cloth of gold, mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants, go before  him, and as the procession moves onward the officer who guides his  elephant cries aloud, `Behold the mighty monarch, the powerful and  valiant Sultan of the Indies, whose palace is covered with a hundred  thousand rubies, who possesses twenty thousand diamond crowns.  Behold  a monarch greater than Solomon and Mihrage in all their glory!'&quot; 
           &quot;Then the one who stands behind the throne answers:  'This king, so  great and powerful, must die, must die, must die!'&quot; 
           &quot;And the first takes up the chant again, `All praise to Him who lives  for evermore.'&quot; 
           &quot;Further, my lord, in Serendib no judge is needed, for to the king  himself his people come for justice.&quot; 
           The Caliph was well satisfied with my report. 
           &quot;From the king's letter,&quot; said he, &quot;I judged that he was a wise man.  It seems that he is worthy of his people, and his people of him.&quot; 
           So saying he dismissed me with rich presents, and I returned in peace  to my own house. 
         When Sindbad had done speaking his guests withdrew, Hindbad having  first received a hundred sequins, but all returned next day to hear the  story of the seventh voyage, Sindbad thus began.
