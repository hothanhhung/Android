           Sire, there was once upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor that he  could scarcely manage to support his wife and three children.  He went  every day to fish very early, and each day he made a rule not to throw  his nets more than four times.  He started out one morning by moonlight  and came to the sea-shore. He undressed and threw his nets, and as he  was drawing them towards the bank he felt a great weight.  He though he  had caught a large fish, and he felt very pleased.  But a moment  afterwards, seeing that instead of a fish he only had in his nets the  carcase of an ass, he was much disappointed. 
           Vexed with having such a bad haul, when he had mended his nets, which  the carcase of the ass had broken in several places, he threw them a  second time.  In drawing them in he again felt a great weight, so that  he thought they were full of fish.  But he only found a large basket  full of rubbish.  He was much annoyed. 
           &quot;O Fortune,&quot; he cried, &quot;do not trifle thus with me, a poor fisherman,  who can hardly support his family!&quot; 
           So saying, he threw away the rubbish, and after having washed his nets  clean of the dirt, he threw them for the third time.  But he only drew  in stones, shells, and mud.  He was almost in despair. 
           Then he threw his nets for the fourth time.  When he thought he had a  fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble.  There was no fish  however, but he found a yellow pot, which by its weight seemed full of  something, and he noticed that it was fastened and sealed with lead,  with the impression of a seal.  He was delighted.  &quot;I will sell it to  the founder,&quot; he said; &quot;with the money I shall get for it I shall buy a  measure of wheat.&quot; 
           He examined the jar on all sides; he shook it to see if it would  rattle.  But he heard nothing, and so, judging from the impression of  the seal and the lid, he thought there must be something precious  inside.  To find out, he took his knife, and with a little trouble he  opened it.  He turned it upside down, but nothing came out, which  surprised him very much.  He set it in front of him, and whilst he was  looking at it attentively, such a thick smoke came out that he had to  step back a pace or two.  This smoke rose up to the clouds, and  stretching over the sea and the shore, formed a thick mist, which  caused the fisherman much astonishment.  When all the smoke was out of  the jar it gathered itself together, and became a thick mass in which  appeared a genius, twice as large as the largest giant.  When he saw  such a terrible-looking monster, the fisherman would like to have run  away, but he trembled so with fright that he could not move a step. 
           &quot;Great king of the genii,&quot; cried the monster, &quot;I will never again  disobey you!&quot; 
           At these words the fisherman took courage. 
           &quot;What is this you are saying, great genius?  Tell me your history and  how you came to be shut up in that vase.&quot; 
           At this, the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily.  &quot;Speak to me  more civilly,&quot; he said, &quot;before I kill you.&quot; 
           &quot;Alas! why should you kill me?&quot; cried the fisherman.  &quot;I have just  freed you; have you already forgotten that?&quot; 
           &quot;No,&quot; answered the genius; &quot;but that will not prevent me from killing  you; and I am only going to grant you one favour, and that is to choose  the manner of your death.&quot; 
           &quot;But what have I done to you?&quot; asked the fisherman. 
           &quot;I cannot treat you in any other way,&quot; said the genius, &quot;and if you  would know why, listen to my story. 
           &quot;I rebelled against the king of the genii.  To punish me, he shut me up  in this vase of copper, and he put on the leaden cover his seal, which  is enchantment enough to prevent my coming out.  Then he had the vase  thrown into the sea.  During the first period of my captivity I vowed  that if anyone should free me before a hundred years were passed, I  would make him rich even after his death.  But that century passed, and  no one freed me.  In the second century I vowed that I would give all  the treasures in the world to my deliverer; but he never came. 
           &quot;In the third, I promised to make him a king, to be always near him,  and to grant him three wishes every day; but that century passed away  as the other two had done, and I remained in the same plight.  At last  I grew angry at being captive for so long, and I vowed that if anyone  would release me I would kill him at once, and would only allow him to  choose in what manner he should die.  So you see, as you have freed me  to-day, choose in what way you will die.&quot; 
           The fisherman was very unhappy.  &quot;What an unlucky man I am to have  freed you!  I implore you to spare my life.&quot; 
           &quot;I have told you,&quot; said the genius, &quot;that it is impossible.  Choose  quickly; you are wasting time.&quot; 
           The fisherman began to devise a plot. 
           &quot;Since I must die,&quot; he said, &quot;before I choose the manner of my death, I  conjure you on your honour to tell me if you really were in that vase?&quot; 
           &quot;Yes, I was,&quot; answered the genius. 
           &quot;I really cannot believe it,&quot; said the fisherman.  &quot;That vase could not  contain one of your feet even, and how could your whole body go in?  I  cannot believe it unless I see you do the thing.&quot; 
           Then the genius began to change himself into smoke, which, as before,  spread over the sea and the shore, and which, then collecting itself  together, began to go back into the vase slowly and evenly till there  was nothing left outside.  Then a voice came from the vase which said  to the fisherman, &quot;Well, unbelieving fisherman, here I am in the vase;  do you believe me now?&quot; 
           The fisherman instead of answering took the lid of lead and shut it  down quickly on the vase. 
           &quot;Now, O genius,&quot; he cried, &quot;ask pardon of me, and choose by what death  you will die!  But no, it will be better if I throw you into the sea  whence I drew you out, and I will build a house on the shore to warn  fishermen who come to cast their nets here, against fishing up such a  wicked genius as you are, who vows to kill the man who frees you.&quot; 
           At these words the genius did all he could to get out, but he could  not, because of the enchantment of the lid. 
           Then he tried to get out by cunning. 
           &quot;If you will take off the cover,&quot; he said, &quot;I will repay you.&quot; 
           &quot;No,&quot; answered the fisherman, &quot;if I trust myself to you I am afraid you  will treat me as a certain Greek king treated the physician Douban.  Listen, and I will tell you.&quot;
