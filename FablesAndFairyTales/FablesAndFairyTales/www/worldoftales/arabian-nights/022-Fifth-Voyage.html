           Not even all that I had gone through could make me contented with a  quiet life.  I soon wearied of its pleasures, and longed for change and  adventure.  Therefore I set out once more, but this time in a ship of  my own, which I built and fitted out at the nearest seaport.  I wished  to be able to call at whatever port I chose, taking my own time; but as  I did not intend carrying enough goods for a full cargo, I invited  several merchants of different nations to join me.  We set sail with  the first favourable wind, and after a long voyage upon the open seas  we landed upon an unknown island which proved to be uninhabited.  We  determined, however, to explore it, but had not gone far when we found  a roc's egg, as large as the one I had seen before and evidently very  nearly hatched, for the beak of the young bird had already pierced the  shell.  In spite of all I could say to deter them, the merchants who  were with me fell upon it with their hatchets, breaking the shell, and  killing the young roc.  Then lighting a fire upon the ground they  hacked morsels from the bird, and proceeded to roast them while I stood  by aghast. 
           Scarcely had they finished their ill-omened repast, when the air above  us was darkened by two mighty shadows.  The captain of my ship, knowing  by experience what this meant, cried out to us that the parent birds  were coming, and urged us to get on board with all speed.  This we did,  and the sails were hoisted, but before we had made any way the rocs  reached their despoiled nest and hovered about it, uttering frightful  cries when they discovered the mangled remains of their young one.  For  a moment we lost sight of them, and were flattering ourselves that we  had escaped, when they reappeared and soared into the air directly over  our vessel, and we saw that each held in its claws an immense rock  ready to crush us.  There was a moment of breathless suspense, then one  bird loosed its hold and the huge block of stone hurtled through the  air, but thanks to the presence of mind of the helmsman, who turned our  ship violently in another direction, it fell into the sea close beside  us, cleaving it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom.  We had  hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rock fell with  a mighty crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel, smashing it  into a thousand fragments, and crushing, or hurling into the sea,  passengers and crew.  I myself went down with the rest, but had the  good fortune to rise unhurt, and by holding on to a piece of driftwood  with one hand and swimming with the other I kept myself afloat and was  presently washed up by the tide on to an island.  Its shores were steep  and rocky, but I scrambled up safely and threw myself down to rest upon  the green turf. 
           When I had somewhat recovered I began to examine the spot in which I  found myself, and truly it seemed to me that I had reached a garden of  delights.  There were trees everywhere, and they were laden with  flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream wandered in and out under  their shadow.  When night came I slept sweetly in a cosy nook, though  the remembrance that I was alone in a strange land made me sometimes  start up and look around me in alarm, and then I wished heartily that I  had stayed at home at ease.  However, the morning sunlight restored my  courage, and I once more wandered among the trees, but always with some  anxiety as to what I might see next.  I had penetrated some distance  into the island when I saw an old man bent and feeble sitting upon the  river bank, and at first I took him to be some ship-wrecked mariner  like myself.  Going up to him I greeted him in a friendly way, but he  only nodded his head at me in reply.  I then asked what he did there,  and he made signs to me that he wished to get across the river to  gather some fruit, and seemed to beg me to carry him on my back.  Pitying his age and feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the  stream I bent down that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade  him get down.  But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet  (even now it makes me laugh to think of it!), this creature who had  seemed to me so decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and hooking  his legs round my neck gripped me so tightly that I was well-nigh  choked, and so overcome with terror that I fell insensible to the  ground.  When I recovered my enemy was still in his place, though he  had released his hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing me  revive he prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the  other, until I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under  the trees while he gathered and ate the choicest fruits.  This went on  all day, and even at night, when I threw myself down half dead with  weariness, the terrible old man held on tight to my neck, nor did he  fail to greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me  with his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march with  rage and bitterness in my heart. 
           It happened one day that I passed a tree under which lay several dry  gourds, and catching one up I amused myself with scooping out its  contents and pressing into it the juice of several bunches of grapes  which hung from every bush.  When it was full I left it propped in the  fork of a tree, and a few days later, carrying the hateful old man that  way, I snatched at my gourd as I passed it and had the satisfaction of  a draught of excellent wine so good and refreshing that I even forgot  my detestable burden, and began to sing and caper. 
           The old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my draught  had produced and that I carried him more lightly than usual, so he  stretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd first tasted its  contents cautiously, then drained them to the very last drop.  The wine  was strong and the gourd capacious, so he also began to sing after a  fashion, and soon I had the delight of feeling the iron grip of his  goblin legs unclasp, and with one vigorous effort I threw him to the  ground, from which he never moved again.  I was so rejoiced to have at  last got rid of this uncanny old man that I ran leaping and bounding  down to the sea shore, where, by the greatest good luck, I met with  some mariners who had anchored off the island to enjoy the delicious  fruits, and to renew their supply of water. 
           They heard the story of my escape with amazement, saying, &quot;You fell  into the hands of the Old Man of the Sea, and it is a mercy that he did  not strangle you as he has everyone else upon whose shoulders he has  managed to perch himself.  This island is well known as the scene of  his evil deeds, and no merchant or sailor who lands upon it cares to  stray far away from his comrades.&quot;  After we had talked for a while  they took me back with them on board their ship, where the captain  received me kindly, and we soon set sail, and after several days  reached a large and prosperous-looking town where all the houses were  built of stone.  Here we anchored, and one of the merchants, who had  been very friendly to me on the way, took me ashore with him and showed  me a lodging set apart for strange merchants.  He then provided me with  a large sack, and pointed out to me a party of others equipped in like  manner. 
           &quot;Go with them,&quot; said he, &quot;and do as they do, but beware of losing sight  of them, for if you strayed your life would be in danger.&quot; 
           With that he supplied me with provisions, and bade me farewell, and I  set out with my new companions.  I soon learnt that the object of our  expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts, but when at length I  saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery  smoothness of their slender trunks, I did not at all understand how we  were to do it.  The crowns of the cocoa-palms were all alive with  monkeys, big and little, which skipped from one to the other with  surprising agility, seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our  appearance, and I was at first surprised when my companions after  collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures, which  seemed to me quite harmless.  But very soon I saw the reason of it and  joined them heartily, for the monkeys, annoyed and wishing to pay us  back in our own coin, began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast  them at us with angry and spiteful gestures, so that after very little  labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not  otherwise have obtained. 
           As soon as we had as many as we could carry we went back to the town,  where my friend bought my share and advised me to continue the same  occupation until I had earned money enough to carry me to my own  country.  This I did, and before long had amassed a considerable sum.  Just then I heard that there was a trading ship ready to sail, and  taking leave of my friend I went on board, carrying with me a goodly  store of cocoanuts; and we sailed first to the islands where pepper  grows, then to Comari where the best aloes wood is found, and where men  drink no wine by an unalterable law.  Here I exchanged my nuts for  pepper and good aloes wood, and went a-fishing for pearls with some of  the other merchants, and my divers were so lucky that very soon I had  an immense number, and those very large and perfect.  With all these  treasures I came joyfully back to Bagdad, where I disposed of them for  large sums of money, of which I did not fail as before to give the  tenth part to the poor, and after that I rested from my labours and  comforted myself with all the pleasures that my riches could give me. 
         Having thus ended his story, Sindbad ordered that one hundred sequins  should be given to Hindbad, and the guests then withdrew; but after the  next day's feast he began the account of his sixth voyage as follows.
