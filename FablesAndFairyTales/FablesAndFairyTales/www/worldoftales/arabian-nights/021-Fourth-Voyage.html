           Rich and happy as I was after my third voyage, I could not make up my  mind to stay at home altogether.  My love of trading, and the pleasure  I took in anything that was new and strange, made me set my affairs in  order, and begin my journey through some of the Persian provinces,  having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming in the  different places I intended to visit.  I took ship at a distant  seaport, and for some time all went well, but at last, being caught in  a violent hurricane, our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all  our worthy captain could do to save her, and many of our company  perished in the waves.  I, with a few others, had the good fortune to  be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck, for the storm had  driven us near an island, and scrambling up beyond the reach of the  waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted, to wait for morning. 
           At daylight we wandered inland, and soon saw some huts, to which we  directed our steps.  As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed  out in great numbers and surrounded us, and we were led to their  houses, and as it were divided among our captors.  I with five others  was taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the ground, and  certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made signs to us to  eat.  Observing that they themselves did not touch them, I was careful  only to pretend to taste my portion; but my companions, being very  hungry, rashly ate up all that was set before them, and very soon I had  the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad.  Though they chattered  incessantly I could not understand a word they said, nor did they heed  when I spoke to them.  The savages now produced large bowls full of  rice prepared with cocoanut oil, of which my crazy comrades ate  eagerly, but I only tasted a few grains, understanding clearly that the  object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating,  and this was exactly what happened.  My unlucky companions having lost  their reason, felt neither anxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all that  was offered them.  So they were soon fat and there was an end of them,  but I grew leaner day by day, for I ate but little, and even that  little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me.  However, as I was so far from being a tempting morsel, I was allowed to  wander about freely, and one day, when all the blacks had gone off upon  some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me, I managed to  escape from him and plunged into the forest, running faster the more he  cried to me to come back, until I had completely distanced him. 
           For seven days I hurried on, resting only when the darkness stopped me,  and living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me both meat and  drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore and saw a party of  white men gathering pepper, which grew abundantly all about.  Reassured  by the nature of their occupation, I advanced towards them and they  greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came.  My delight  was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willingly satisfied  their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked, and captured  by the blacks.  &quot;But these savages devour men!&quot; said they.  &quot;How did  you escape?&quot;  I repeated to them what I have just told you, at which  they were mightily astonished.  I stayed with them until they had  collected as much pepper as they wished, and then they took me back to  their own country and presented me to their king, by whom I was  hospitably received.  To him also I had to relate my adventures, which  surprised him much, and when I had finished he ordered that I should be  supplied with food and raiment and treated with consideration. 
           The island on which I found myself was full of people, and abounded in  all sorts of desirable things, and a great deal of traffic went on in  the capital, where I soon began to feel at home and contented.  Moreover, the king treated me with special favour, and in consequence  of this everyone, whether at the court or in the town, sought to make  life pleasant to me.  One thing I remarked which I thought very  strange; this was that, from the greatest to the least, all men rode  their horses without bridle or stirrups.  I one day presumed to ask his  majesty why he did not use them, to which he replied, &quot;You speak to me  of things of which I have never before heard!&quot;  This gave me an idea.  I found a clever workman, and made him cut out under my direction the  foundation of a saddle, which I wadded and covered with choice leather,  adorning it with rich gold embroidery.  I then got a lock-smith to make  me a bit and a pair of spurs after a pattern that I drew for him, and  when all these things were completed I presented them to the king and  showed him how to use them.  When I had saddled one of his horses he  mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty, and to show  his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts.  After this I had to  make saddles for all the principal officers of the king's household,  and as they all gave me rich presents I soon became very wealthy and  quite an important person in the city. 
           One day the king sent for me and said, &quot;Sindbad, I am going to ask a  favour of you.  Both I and my subjects esteem you, and wish you to end  your days amongst us.  Therefore I desire that you will marry a rich  and beautiful lady whom I will find for you, and think no more of your  own country.&quot; 
           As the king's will was law I accepted the charming bride he presented  to me, and lived happily with her.  Nevertheless I had every intention  of escaping at the first opportunity, and going back to Bagdad.  Things  were thus going prosperously with me when it happened that the wife of  one of my neighbours, with whom I had struck up quite a friendship,  fell ill, and presently died.  I went to his house to offer my  consolations, and found him in the depths of woe. 
           &quot;Heaven preserve you,&quot; said I, &quot;and send you a long life!&quot; 
           &quot;Alas!&quot; he replied, &quot;what is the good of saying that when I have but an  hour left to live!&quot; 
           &quot;Come, come!&quot; said I, &quot;surely it is not so bad as all that.  I trust  that you may be spared to me for many years.&quot; 
           &quot;I hope,&quot; answered he, &quot;that your life may be long, but as for me, all  is finished.  I have set my house in order, and to-day I shall be  buried with my wife.  This has been the law upon our island from the  earliest ages--the living husband goes to the grave with his dead wife,  the living wife with her dead husband.  So did our fathers, and so must  we do.  The law changes not, and all must submit to it!&quot; 
           As he spoke the friends and relations of the unhappy pair began to  assemble.  The body, decked in rich robes and sparkling with jewels,  was laid upon an open bier, and the procession started, taking its way  to a high mountain at some distance from the city, the wretched  husband, clothed from head to foot in a black mantle, following  mournfully. 
           When the place of interment was reached the corpse was lowered, just as  it was, into a deep pit.  Then the husband, bidding farewell to all his  friends, stretched himself upon another bier, upon which were laid  seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher of water, and he also was  let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible cavern, and then a  stone was laid over the opening, and the melancholy company wended its  way back to the city. 
           You may imagine that I was no unmoved spectator of these proceedings;  to all the others it was a thing to which they had been accustomed from  their youth up; but I was so horrified that I could not help telling  the king how it struck me. 
           &quot;Sire,&quot; I said, &quot;I am more astonished than I can express to you at the  strange custom which exists in your dominions of burying the living  with the dead.  In all my travels I have never before met with so cruel  and horrible a law.&quot; 
           &quot;What would you have, Sindbad?&quot; he replied.  &quot;It is the law for  everybody.  I myself should be buried with the Queen if she were the  first to die.&quot; 
           &quot;But, your Majesty,&quot; said I, &quot;dare I ask if this law applies to  foreigners also?&quot; 
           &quot;Why, yes,&quot; replied the king smiling, in what I could but consider a  very heartless manner, &quot;they are no exception to the rule if they have  married in the country.&quot; 
           When I heard this I went home much cast down, and from that time  forward my mind was never easy.  If only my wife's little finger ached  I fancied she was going to die, and sure enough before very long she  fell really ill and in a few days breathed her last.  My dismay was  great, for it seemed to me that to be buried alive was even a worse  fate than to be devoured by cannibals, nevertheless there was no  escape.  The body of my wife, arrayed in her richest robes and decked  with all her jewels, was laid upon the bier.  I followed it, and after  me came a great procession, headed by the king and all his nobles, and  in this order we reached the fatal mountain, which was one of a lofty  chain bordering the sea. 
           Here I made one more frantic effort to excite the pity of the king and  those who stood by, hoping to save myself even at this last moment, but  it was of no avail.  No one spoke to me, they even appeared to hasten  over their dreadful task, and I speedily found myself descending into  the gloomy pit, with my seven loaves and pitcher of water beside me.  Almost before I reached the bottom the stone was rolled into its place  above my head, and I was left to my fate.  A feeble ray of light shone  into the cavern through some chink, and when I had the courage to look  about me I could see that I was in a vast vault, bestrewn with bones  and bodies of the dead.  I even fancied that I heard the expiring sighs  of those who, like myself, had come into this dismal place alive.  All  in vain did I shriek aloud with rage and despair, reproaching myself  for the love of gain and adventure which had brought me to such a pass,  but at length, growing calmer, I took up my bread and water, and  wrapping my face in my mantle I groped my way towards the end of the  cavern, where the air was fresher. 
           Here I lived in darkness and misery until my provisions were exhausted,  but just as I was nearly dead from starvation the rock was rolled away  overhead and I saw that a bier was being lowered into the cavern, and  that the corpse upon it was a man.  In a moment my mind was made up,  the woman who followed had nothing to expect but a lingering death; I  should be doing her a service if I shortened her misery.  Therefore  when she descended, already insensible from terror, I was ready armed  with a huge bone, one blow from which left her dead, and I secured the  bread and water which gave me a hope of life.  Several times did I have  recourse to this desperate expedient, and I know not how long I had  been a prisoner when one day I fancied that I heard something near me,  which breathed loudly.  Turning to the place from which the sound came  I dimly saw a shadowy form which fled at my movement, squeezing itself  through a cranny in the wall.  I pursued it as fast as I could, and  found myself in a narrow crack among the rocks, along which I was just  able to force my way.  I followed it for what seemed to me many miles,  and at last saw before me a glimmer of light which grew clearer every  moment until I emerged upon the sea shore with a joy which I cannot  describe.  When I was sure that I was not dreaming, I realised that it  was doubtless some little animal which had found its way into the  cavern from the sea, and when disturbed had fled, showing me a means of  escape which I could never have discovered for myself.  I hastily  surveyed my surroundings, and saw that I was safe from all pursuit from  the town. 
           The mountains sloped sheer down to the sea, and there was no road  across them.  Being assured of this I returned to the cavern, and  amassed a rich treasure of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and jewels of  all kinds which strewed the ground.  These I made up into bales, and  stored them into a safe place upon the beach, and then waited hopefully  for the passing of a ship.  I had looked out for two days, however,  before a single sail appeared, so it was with much delight that I at  last saw a vessel not very far from the shore, and by waving my arms  and uttering loud cries succeeded in attracting the attention of her  crew.  A boat was sent off to me, and in answer to the questions of the  sailors as to how I came to be in such a plight, I replied that I had  been shipwrecked two days before, but had managed to scramble ashore  with the bales which I pointed out to them.  Luckily for me they  believed my story, and without even looking at the place where they  found me, took up my bundles, and rowed me back to the ship.  Once on  board, I soon saw that the captain was too much occupied with the  difficulties of navigation to pay much heed to me, though he generously  made me welcome, and would not even accept the jewels with which I  offered to pay my passage.  Our voyage was prosperous, and after  visiting many lands, and collecting in each place great store of goodly  merchandise, I found myself at last in Bagdad once more with unheard of  riches of every description.  Again I gave large sums of money to the  poor, and enriched all the mosques in the city, after which I gave  myself up to my friends and relations, with whom I passed my time in  feasting and merriment. 
           Here Sindbad paused, and all his hearers declared that the adventures  of his fourth voyage had pleased them better than anything they had  heard before.  They then took their leave, followed by Hindbad, who had  once more received a hundred sequins, and with the rest had been bidden  to return next day for the story of the fifth voyage. 
         When the time came all were in their places, and when they had eaten  and drunk of all that was set before them Sindbad began his tale.
