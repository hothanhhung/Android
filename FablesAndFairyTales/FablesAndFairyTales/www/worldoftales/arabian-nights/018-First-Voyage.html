           I had inherited considerable wealth from my parents, and being young  and foolish I at first squandered it recklessly upon every kind of  pleasure, but presently, finding that riches speedily take to  themselves wings if managed as badly as I was managing mine, and  remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed, I began to  bethink me of how I could make the best of what still remained to me.  I sold all my household goods by public auction, and joined a company  of merchants who traded by sea, embarking with them at Balsora in a  ship which we had fitted out between us. 
           We set sail and took our course towards the East Indies by the Persian  Gulf, having the coast of Persia upon our left hand and upon our right  the shores of Arabia Felix.  I was at first much troubled by the uneasy  motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered my health, and since that  hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness. 
           From time to time we landed at various islands, where we sold or  exchanged our merchandise, and one day, when the wind dropped suddenly,  we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green  meadow, which only rose slightly above the surface of the water.  Our  sails were furled, and the captain gave permission to all who wished to  land for a while and amuse themselves.  I was among the number, but  when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down  to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us, we were startled by a  sudden and violent trembling of the island, while at the same moment  those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for  our lives, since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the  back of a sleeping whale.  Those who were nearest to the boat threw  themselves into it, others sprang into the sea, but before I could save  myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean, leaving  me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our  fire.  Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that  ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those  who were in the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed me and I  was left at the mercy of the waves.  All that day I floated up and  down, now beaten this way, now that, and when night fell I despaired  for my life; but, weary and spent as I was, I clung to my frail  support, and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I  had drifted against an island. 
           The cliffs were high and steep, but luckily for me some tree-roots  protruded in places, and by their aid I climbed up at last, and  stretched myself upon the turf at the top, where I lay, more dead than  alive, till the sun was high in the heavens.  By that time I was very  hungry, but after some searching I came upon some eatable herbs, and a  spring of clear water, and much refreshed I set out to explore the  island.  Presently I reached a great plain where a grazing horse was  tethered, and as I stood looking at it I heard voices talking  apparently underground, and in a moment a man appeared who asked me how  I came upon the island.  I told him my adventures, and heard in return  that he was one of the grooms of Mihrage, the king of the island, and  that each year they came to feed their master's horses in this plain.  He took me to a cave where his companions were assembled, and when I  had eaten of the food they set before me, they bade me think myself  fortunate to have come upon them when I did, since they were going back  to their master on the morrow, and without their aid I could certainly  never have found my way to the inhabited part of the island. 
           Early the next morning we accordingly set out, and when we reached the  capital I was graciously received by the king, to whom I related my  adventures, upon which he ordered that I should be well cared for and  provided with such things as I needed.  Being a merchant I sought out  men of my own profession, and particularly those who came from foreign  countries, as I hoped in this way to hear news from Bagdad, and find  out some means of returning thither, for the capital was situated upon  the sea-shore, and visited by vessels from all parts of the world.  In  the meantime I heard many curious things, and answered many questions  concerning my own country, for I talked willingly with all who came to  me.  Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island  named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to  be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial.  Indeed, the sailors assured me  that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it.  However, I saw nothing strange upon my voyage, saving some fish that  were full two hundred cubits long, but were fortunately more in dread  of us than even we were of them, and fled from us if we did but strike  upon a board to frighten them.  Other fishes there were only a cubit  long which had heads like owls. 
           One day after my return, as I went down to the quay, I saw a ship which  had just cast anchor, and was discharging her cargo, while the  merchants to whom it belonged were busily directing the removal of it  to their warehouses.  Drawing nearer I presently noticed that my own  name was marked upon some of the packages, and after having carefully  examined them, I felt sure that they were indeed those which I had put  on board our ship at Balsora.  I then recognised the captain of the  vessel, but as I was certain that he believed me to be dead, I went up  to him and asked who owned the packages that I was looking at. 
           &quot;There was on board my ship,&quot; he replied, &quot;a merchant of Bagdad named  Sindbad.  One day he and several of my other passengers landed upon  what we supposed to be an island, but which was really an enormous  whale floating asleep upon the waves.  No sooner did it feel upon its  back the heat of the fire which had been kindled, than it plunged into  the depths of the sea.  Several of the people who were upon it perished  in the waters, and among others this unlucky Sindbad.  This merchandise  is his, but I have resolved to dispose of it for the benefit of his  family if I should ever chance to meet with them.&quot; 
           &quot;Captain,&quot; said I, &quot;I am that Sindbad whom you believe to be dead, and  these are my possessions!&quot; 
           When the captain heard these words he cried out in amazement,  &quot;Lackaday! and what is the world coming to?  In these days there is not  an honest man to be met with.  Did I not with my own eyes see Sindbad  drown, and now you have the audacity to tell me that you are he!  I  should have taken you to be a just man, and yet for the sake of  obtaining that which does not belong to you, you are ready to invent  this horrible falsehood.&quot; 
           &quot;Have patience, and do me the favour to hear my story,&quot; said I. 
           &quot;Speak then,&quot; replied the captain, &quot;I'm all attention.&quot; 
           So I told him of my escape and of my fortunate meeting with the king's  grooms, and how kindly I had been received at the palace.  Very soon I  began to see that I had made some impression upon him, and after the  arrival of some of the other merchants, who showed great joy at once  more seeing me alive, he declared that he also recognised me. 
           Throwing himself upon my neck he exclaimed, &quot;Heaven be praised that you  have escaped from so great a danger.  As to your goods, I pray you take  them, and dispose of them as you please.&quot; I thanked him, and praised  his honesty, begging him to accept several bales of merchandise in  token of my gratitude, but he would take nothing.  Of the choicest of  my goods I prepared a present for King Mihrage, who was at first  amazed, having known that I had lost my all.  However, when I had  explained to him how my bales had been miraculously restored to me, he  graciously accepted my gifts, and in return gave me many valuable  things.  I then took leave of him, and exchanging my merchandise for  sandal and aloes wood, camphor, nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger, I  embarked upon the same vessel and traded so successfully upon our  homeward voyage that I arrived in Balsora with about one hundred  thousand sequins.  My family received me with as much joy as I felt  upon seeing them once more.  I bought land and slaves, and built a  great house in which I resolved to live happily, and in the enjoyment  of all the pleasures of life to forget my past sufferings. 
           Here Sindbad paused, and commanded the musicians to play again, while  the feasting continued until evening.  When the time came for the  porter to depart, Sindbad gave him a purse containing one hundred  sequins, saying, &quot;Take this, Hindbad, and go home, but to-morrow come  again and you shall hear more of my adventures.&quot; 
           The porter retired quite overcome by so much generosity, and you may  imagine that he was well received at home, where his wife and children  thanked their lucky stars that he had found such a benefactor. 
           The next day Hindbad, dressed in his best, returned to the voyager's  house, and was received with open arms.  As soon as all the guests had  arrived the banquet began as before, and when they had feasted long and  merrily, Sindbad addressed them thus: 
         &quot;My friends, I beg that you will give me your attention while I relate  the adventures of my second voyage, which you will find even more  astonishing than the first.&quot;
