           After my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would go to sea no  more.  I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life, and I had run  risks enough.  I only wished to end my days in peace.  One day,  however, when I was entertaining a number of my friends, I was told  that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me, and when he was  admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of Haroun al Raschid,  which I accordingly did.  After I had saluted him, the Caliph said: 
           &quot;I have sent for you, Sindbad, because I need your services.  I have  chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib in  return for his message of friendship.&quot; 
           The Caliph's commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt. 
           &quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; I answered, &quot;I am ready to do all that  your Majesty commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that I am  utterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings I have undergone.  Indeed, I have made a vow never again to leave Bagdad.&quot; 
           With this I gave him a long account of some of my strangest adventures,  to which he listened patiently. 
           &quot;I admit,&quot; said he, &quot;that you have indeed had some extraordinary  experiences, but I do not see why they should hinder you from doing as  I wish.  You have only to go straight to Serendib and give my message,  then you are free to come back and do as you will.  But go you must; my  honour and dignity demand it.&quot; 
           Seeing that there was no help for it, I declared myself willing to  obey; and the Caliph, delighted at having got his own way, gave me a  thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage.  I was soon ready to  start, and taking the letter and the present I embarked at Balsora, and  sailed quickly and safely to Serendib.  Here, when I had disclosed my  errand, I was well received, and brought into the presence of the king,  who greeted me with joy. 
           &quot;Welcome, Sindbad,&quot; he cried.  &quot;I have thought of you often, and  rejoice to see you once more.&quot; 
           After thanking him for the honour that he did me, I displayed the  Caliph's gifts.  First a bed with complete hangings all cloth of gold,  which cost a thousand sequins, and another like to it of crimson stuff.  Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the finest white linen  from Cairo, Suez, Cufa, and Alexandria.  Then more beds of different  fashion, and an agate vase carved with the figure of a man aiming an  arrow at a lion, and finally a costly table, which had once belonged to  King Solomon.  The King of Serendib received with satisfaction the  assurance of the Caliph's friendliness toward him, and now my task  being accomplished I was anxious to depart, but it was some time before  the king would think of letting me go.  At last, however, he dismissed  me with many presents, and I lost no time in going on board a ship,  which sailed at once, and for four days all went well.  On the fifth  day we had the misfortune to fall in with pirates, who seized our  vessel, killing all who resisted, and making prisoners of those who  were prudent enough to submit at once, of whom I was one.  When they  had despoiled us of all we possessed, they forced us to put on vile  raiment, and sailing to a distant island there sold us for slaves.  I  fell into the hands of a rich merchant, who took me home with him, and  clothed and fed me well, and after some days sent for me and questioned  me as to what I could do. 
           I answered that I was a rich merchant who had been captured by pirates,  and therefore I knew no trade. 
           &quot;Tell me,&quot; said he, &quot;can you shoot with a bow?&quot; 
           I replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth, and that  doubtless with practice my skill would come back to me. 
           Upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows, and mounting me with  him upon his own elephant took the way to a vast forest which lay far  from the town.  When we had reached the wildest part of it we stopped,  and my master said to me:  &quot;This forest swarms with elephants.  Hide  yourself in this great tree, and shoot at all that pass you.  When you  have succeeded in killing one come and tell me.&quot; 
           So saying he gave me a supply of food, and returned to the town, and I  perched myself high up in the tree and kept watch.  That night I saw  nothing, but just after sunrise the next morning a large herd of  elephants came crashing and trampling by.  I lost no time in letting  fly several arrows, and at last one of the great animals fell to the  ground dead, and the others retreated, leaving me free to come down  from my hiding place and run back to tell my master of my success, for  which I was praised and regaled with good things.  Then we went back to  the forest together and dug a mighty trench in which we buried the  elephant I had killed, in order that when it became a skeleton my  master might return and secure its tusks. 
           For two months I hunted thus, and no day passed without my securing, an  elephant.  Of course I did not always station myself in the same tree,  but sometimes in one place, sometimes in another.  One morning as I  watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised to see that,  instead of passing the tree I was in, as they usually did, they paused,  and completely surrounded it, trumpeting horribly, and shaking the very  ground with their heavy tread, and when I saw that their eyes were  fixed upon me I was terrified, and my arrows dropped from my trembling  hand.  I had indeed good reason for my terror when, an instant later,  the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree,  and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots, bringing me to the  ground entangled in its branches.  I thought now that my last hour was  surely come; but the huge creature, picking me up gently enough, set me  upon its back, where I clung more dead than alive, and followed by the  whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest.  It seemed to  me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the elephant,  and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd, which turned and  trampled off in another direction, and were soon hidden in the dense  underwood.  Then, recovering myself, I looked about me, and found that  I was standing upon the side of a great hill, strewn as far as I could  see on either hand with bones and tusks of elephants.  &quot;This then must  be the elephants' burying place,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;and they must have  brought me here that I might cease to persecute them, seeing that I  want nothing but their tusks, and here lie more than I could carry away  in a lifetime.&quot; 
           Whereupon I turned and made for the city as fast as I could go, not  seeing a single elephant by the way, which convinced me that they had  retired deeper into the forest to leave the way open to the Ivory Hill,  and I did not know how sufficiently to admire their sagacity.  After a  day and a night I reached my master's house, and was received by him  with joyful surprise. 
           &quot;Ah! poor Sindbad,&quot; he cried, &quot;I was wondering what could have become  of you.  When I went to the forest I found the tree newly uprooted, and  the arrows lying beside it, and I feared I should never see you again.  Pray tell me how you escaped death.&quot; 
           I soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went together to  the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find that I had told him  nothing but the truth.  When we had loaded our elephant with as many  tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to the city, he said: 
           &quot;My brother--since I can no longer treat as a slave one who has  enriched me thus--take your liberty and may Heaven prosper you.  I will  no longer conceal from you that these wild elephants have killed  numbers of our slaves every year.  No matter what good advice we gave  them, they were caught sooner or later.  You alone have escaped the  wiles of these animals, therefore you must be under the special  protection of Heaven.  Now through you the whole town will be enriched  without further loss of life, therefore you shall not only receive your  liberty, but I will also bestow a fortune upon you.&quot; 
           To which I replied, &quot;Master, I thank you, and wish you all prosperity.  For myself I only ask liberty to return to my own country.&quot; 
           &quot;It is well,&quot; he answered, &quot;the monsoon will soon bring the ivory ships  hither, then I will send you on your way with somewhat to pay your  passage.&quot; 
           So I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon, and every day we  added to our store of ivory till all his ware-houses were overflowing  with it.  By this time the other merchants knew the secret, but there  was enough and to spare for all.  When the ships at last arrived my  master himself chose the one in which I was to sail, and put on board  for me a great store of choice provisions, also ivory in abundance, and  all the costliest curiosities of the country, for which I could not  thank him enough, and so we parted.  I left the ship at the first port  we came to, not feeling at ease upon the sea after all that had  happened to me by reason of it, and having disposed of my ivory for  much gold, and bought many rare and costly presents, I loaded my pack  animals, and joined a caravan of merchants.  Our journey was long and  tedious, but I bore it patiently, reflecting that at least I had not to  fear tempests, nor pirates, nor serpents, nor any of the other perils  from which I had suffered before, and at length we reached Bagdad.  My  first care was to present myself before the Caliph, and give him an  account of my embassy.  He assured me that my long absence had  disquieted him much, but he had nevertheless hoped for the best.  As to  my adventure among the elephants he heard it with amazement, declaring  that he could not have believed it had not my truthfulness been well  known to him. 
           By his orders this story and the others I had told him were written by  his scribes in letters of gold, and laid up among his treasures.  I  took my leave of him, well satisfied with the honours and rewards he  bestowed upon me; and since that time I have rested from my labours,  and given myself up wholly to my family and my friends. 
           Thus Sindbad ended the story of his seventh and last voyage, and  turning to Hindbad he added: 
           &quot;Well, my friend, and what do you think now?  Have you ever heard of  anyone who has suffered more, or had more narrow escapes than I have?  Is it not just that I should now enjoy a life of ease and tranquillity?&quot; 
           Hindbad drew near, and kissing his hand respectfully, replied, &quot;Sir,  you have indeed known fearful perils; my troubles have been nothing  compared to yours.  Moreover, the generous use you make of your wealth  proves that you deserve it.  May you live long and happily in the  enjoyment in it.&quot; 
         Sindbad then gave him a hundred sequins, and hence-forward counted him  among his friends; also he caused him to give up his profession as a  porter, and to eat daily at his table that he might all his life  remember Sindbad the Sailor.
