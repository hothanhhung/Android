          Once upon a time there was a father with three sons who had reached  the age when they must go out into the world to earn their own living.  When the time for parting came he gave to each of them a large melon  with the advice that they open the melons only at a place where there  was water nearby.
          The three brothers set out from their father's house, each taking a  different path. As soon as the eldest son was out of sight of the  house he opened his melon. A beautiful maiden sprang out of the melon saying, &quot;Give me water or give me milk.&quot; There was no water nearby and  neither did the young man have any milk to give her. She fell down  dead.
          The second son left his father's house by a path which led over a  steep hill. The large melon was heavy to carry and in a little while  he became very tired and thirsty. He saw no water nearby and feared  that there was no possibility of finding any soon, so he thought he  would open the melon and use it to quench his thirst. Accordingly he  opened his melon. To his great surprise, a beautiful maiden sprang  forth saying, &quot;Give me water or give me milk.&quot; Of course he had  neither to give her and she fell down dead.
          The third son also travelled by a path which led over a steep hill.  He, too, became very tired and thirsty and he often thought how much  he would like to open his melon. However, he remembered his father's  advice to open it only where there was water nearby. So he travelled  on and on hoping to find a spring of water on the hillside. He did not  have the good fortune to pass near a spring either going up the hill  or coming down on the opposite side. At the foot of the hill there was  a town and in the centre of the town there was a fountain. The young  man hurried straight to the fountain and took a long refreshing drink.  Then he opened his melon. A beautiful maiden sprang forth saying,  &quot;Give me water or give me milk.&quot; The young man gave her a drink of  water. Then he helped her to a hiding place among the thick branches  of the tree which grew beside the fountain and went away in search of  food.
          Soon a little black servant girl came to the fountain to fill a big  water jar which she carried on her head. The maiden in the tree above  the fountain peeped out through the branches. When the little black  servant girl bent over the water to fill her jar she saw the  reflection of a charming face in the water. &quot;How beautiful I have  become,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;How ridiculous that any one as  beautiful as I am should carry water on her head.&quot; She threw her water  jar upon the ground in disdain and it broke into a thousand pieces.
          When the little maid reached home with neither water nor water jar her  mistress punished her severely and sent her again to the fountain  with a new water jar to fill. This time the maiden in the tree gave a  little silvery laugh when the black servant girl bent over the water.  The little maid looked up and spied her in the tree. &quot;O, it is you, is  it, who are responsible for my beating?&quot; she said. She pulled a pin  out of her camisa and, reaching up, she stuck it savagely into the  beautiful maiden in the tree. Then a strange thing happened. There was  no longer any beautiful maiden in the tree. There was just a pigeon  there.
          At that moment the young man came back to the tree with the food he  had procured. When the little black maid heard his footsteps she was  frightened nearly to death. She hid herself quickly among the thick  branches of the tree. The young man was very much surprised to find a little black maid in the tree in the place of the beautiful maiden he  had left there. &quot;What has happened to you during my absence&quot; he asked  in horror as soon as he saw her. &quot;The sun has burned my complexion.  That is all. It is nothing. I shall be myself again when I get away  from this hot place,&quot; the little maid replied.
          The young man married the little black maid and took her away out of  sunny places hoping that she would soon be again the beautiful maiden  she was when he left her by the fountain in search of food. But she  always remained black.
          Years passed and the young man became very rich. He lived in a  beautiful mansion. All around the house there was a wonderful garden  full of lovely flowers and splendid trees where birds loved to sing  sweet songs and build their nests. In spite of his beautiful home the  young man was not very happy. It was a great trial to have a wife who  was so black. He often walked up and down the paths in his garden at  the close of the day and thought about how beautiful his wife had been  the first time he ever saw her. As he walked in the garden there was  always a pigeon which followed him about. It flew about his head in a  way that annoyed him, so one day when his wife was sick and asked for  a pigeon to be roasted for her dinner he commanded that this  particular pigeon should be killed.
          When the cook was preparing the pigeon for her mistress to eat for  dinner she noticed a black speck on the pigeon' s breast. She thought  that it was a speck of dirt and tried to brush it away. To her  surprise she could not brush it off easily because it was a pin firmly  embedded in the pigeon's breast. She pulled and pulled but could not  pull it out so she sent for her master to come and see what he could  do to remove it. He at once pulled out the pin and then a wonderful  thing happened. The pigeon was transformed into a beautiful maiden. He  at once recognised her as the same lovely maiden who had sprung forth  from his melon by the fountain and whom he had left hidden in the  tree.
          When the young man's black wife learned that her husband had found the  beautiful maiden again after all these years she confessed her deceit  and soon died. The young man married the beautiful maiden who was  still just as beautiful as she was the first time he saw her. They  were very happy together but the wife never forgot about the time she  had been a pigeon.
          Up to that time pigeons had been wild birds who built their nests in  the deep forest. The wife often wished that they would build their  nests in her beautiful garden so she had little bird houses built and  set up there.
          One day a pigeon, bolder than the rest, flew through the garden and  spied the little bird houses. He moved his family there at once and  told the other pigeons that there were other houses there for them  too. The other pigeons were timid and so they waited to see what  terrible calamity might happen to the bold pigeon and his family, but  not a single unpleasant thing occurred. They were just as happy as  happy could be in their new home.
          After a while other pigeon families moved into the garden and were  happy too. Thus it came about that after years and years the pigeons  no longer build their nests in the deep forest, but they always make  their homes near the homes of men. The pigeons, themselves, do not  know how it all came about, but the beautiful woman who was once a  pigeon, when she had children of her own, told them about it, and they  told their children. Thus it happens that the mothers in Brazil tell  their children this story about the pigeon.
