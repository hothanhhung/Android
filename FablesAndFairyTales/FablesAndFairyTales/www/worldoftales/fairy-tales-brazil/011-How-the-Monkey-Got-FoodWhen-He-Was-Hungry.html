          Once upon a time the monkey was hungry. He wanted to make some  porridge, but he did not have any money to buy meal to make the  porridge. So he went to the house of the hen to borrow some meal. The  hen gave him some meal.
          &quot;Come to my house to-morrow at one o'clock,&quot; he said to the hen, &quot;I'll  pay back the meal then.&quot;
          Then the monkey went to the house of the fox and said, &quot;O, friend fox,  please lend me some meal. Come to my house to - morrow at two o'clock  and I'll pay you then.&quot; The fox gave him some meal.
          Then the monkey went to the house of the dog and said, &quot;O, friend dog,  please lend me some meal. Come to my house to-morrow at three o'clock  and I'll pay you back then.&quot; The dog gave him some meal.
          Then the monkey went to the house of the tiger and said, &quot;O, friend  tiger, please lend me some meal. Come to my house to-morrow at four  o'clock and I'll pay you back then.&quot; The tiger gave the monkey some  meal.
          The monkey went home and made a great pot of porridge. He feasted and  feasted until he couldn't eat any more, but there was still plenty of  porridge left in the pot. Then the monkey made his bed and took care  to fix it high up from the floor.
          The next day, at midday, he ate some more of the porridge. Then he  bound a cloth about his head and went to bed pretending that he was  sick.
          At one o'clock the hen came and knocked at the door. The monkey in a  low, weak voice asked her to enter. He told her how very sick he was  and the hen was very sorry for him.
          At two o'clock the fox came and knocked at the door. The hen was  frightened almost to death. &quot;Never mind,&quot; said the monkey, &quot;you can  hide here under my bed.&quot;
          The hen hid under the monkey's bed and the monkey in a weak, low voice  invited the fox to enter. The monkey told the fox how very ill he was  and the fox was very sorry for him.
          At three o'clock the dog came and knocked at the door. The fox was  frightened almost to death. &quot;Never mind,&quot; said the monkey; &quot;hide here  under my bed and everything will be all right.&quot;
          The fox hid under the monkey's bed and the monkey, in a low, weak  voice, invited the dog to enter. The monkey told the dog how very sick  he was and the dog was very sorry for him.
          At four the tiger came and knocked at the door. The dog was frightened  almost to death. &quot;Never mind,&quot; said the monkey. &quot;Hide here under my  bed and everything will be all right.&quot;
          The dog hid under the monkey's bed. Then the monkey invited the tiger  to enter. He told, the tiger how very sick he was but the tiger was  not at all sorry for him. He sprang at the bed, demanding in a loud,  fierce voice that the monkey pay back the meal at once, as he had  promised to do. The monkey escaped to the tree tops, but the bed broke  down under the tiger's weight.
          Then the fox ate up the hen and the dog ate up the fox and the tiger  ate up the dog. The tiger is still trying to catch the monkey.
