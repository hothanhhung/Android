          Once upon a time the monkey and the rabbit made a contract. The monkey  was to kill all the butterflies and the rabbit was to kill all the  snakes.
          One day the rabbit was taking a nap when the monkey passed that way.  The monkey thought that he would play a trick on the rabbit so he  pulled the rabbit's ears, pretending that he thought they were  butterflies. The rabbit awoke very angry at the monkey and he plotted  how he might revenge himself on the monkey.
          The rabbit and the armadillo are very good friends. The armadillo is  very, very strong, you know, so it was he whom the rabbit asked to  help him.
          One day the rabbit caught the monkey napping. He had watched and  waited a long, long time to catch the monkey napping, but at last he  succeeded. Even the monkey sometimes takes a nap. The rabbit called  the armadillo at once and together they rolled a big stone upon the  monkey's tail. The monkey pulled so hard to get his tail out from  under the stone that it broke off. The cat, who at that time had no  tail of her own, spied the tail and ran away with it. The monkey was  very angry at the rabbit. &quot;O, we thought it was just a snake lying  there,&quot; said the rabbit. &quot;When you pulled my ears, you know, you  thought they were butterflies.&quot;
          That did not help the monkey to feel any better. How was he to live  without his tail! How could he climb without it! He simply had to have  it back so he at once set out to find the cat.
          At last he found the cat and said to her, &quot;O, kind cat, please give me  back my tail.&quot;
          &quot;I will give it to you,&quot; replied the cat, &quot;if you will get me some  milk.&quot;
          &quot;Where shall I get the milk?&quot; asked the monkey.
          &quot;Go ask the cow for some,&quot; replied the cat.
          The monkey went to the cow and said, &quot;O, kind cow, please give me some  milk that I may give the milk to the cat so that the cat will give  back my tail to me.&quot;
          &quot;I will give you the milk,&quot; replied the cow, &quot;if you will get me some  grass.&quot;
          &quot;Where shall I get the grass?&quot; asked the monkey.
          &quot;Go ask the farmer,&quot; responded the cow.
          The monkey went to the farmer and said, &quot;O, kind farmer, please give  me some grass that I may give the grass to the cow so that the cow  will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to the cat so that  the cat will give back my tail to me.&quot;
          The farmer said, &quot;I will give you some grass if you will give me some  rain.&quot;
          &quot;Where shall I get the rain?&quot; asked the monkey.
          &quot;Go ask the clouds,&quot; responded the farmer.
          The monkey went to the clouds and said, &quot;O, kind clouds, please send  me down some rain that I may give the rain to the farmer so that the  farmer will give me some grass so that I may give the grass to the cow  so that the cow will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to  the cat so that the cat will give me back my tail.&quot;
          &quot;I will give you some rain,&quot; replied the clouds, &quot;if you will get me  some fog.&quot;
          &quot;Where shall I get the fog?&quot; asked the monkey.
          &quot;Go ask the rivers,&quot; replied the clouds.
          The monkey went to the river and said, &quot;O, kind river, please give me  a fog that I may give the fog to the clouds so that the clouds will  give some rain so that I may give the rain to the farmer so that the  farmer will give me some grass so that I may give the grass to the cow  so that the cow will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to  the cat so that the cat will give me back my tail.&quot;
          &quot;I will give you a fog,&quot; replied the river, &quot;if you will find a new  spring to feed me.&quot;
          &quot;Where shall I find a spring?&quot; asked the monkey.
          &quot;Go search for one among the rocks upon the hillside,&quot; replied the  river.
          Then the monkey climbed up the steep hill and searched and searched  among the rocks until at last he found a little spring to feed the  river. He brought the spring to the river and the river gave him a  fog. He took the fog to the clouds and the clouds gave him rain. He  took the rain to the farmer and the farmer gave him grass. He took the  grass to the cow and the cow gave him milk. He took the milk to the  cat and the cat gave him back his tail. The monkey was so glad to have  his tail again that he danced and danced with glee. Ever since that  time the monkey has been very careful to guard his tail. He still has  one and he is still happy because of it.
