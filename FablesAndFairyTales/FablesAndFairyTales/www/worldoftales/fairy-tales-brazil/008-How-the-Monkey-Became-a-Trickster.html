          Once upon a time there was a beautiful garden in which grew all sorts  of fruits. Many beasts lived in the garden and they were permitted to  eat of the fruits whenever they wished. But they were asked to observe  one rule. They must make a low, polite bow to the fruit tree, call it  by its name, and say, &quot;Please give me a taste of your fruit.&quot; They had  to be very careful to remember the tree's correct name and not to  forget to say &quot;please.&quot; It was also very important that they should  remember not to be greedy. They must always leave plenty of fruit for  the other beasts who might pass that way, and plenty to adorn the tree  itself and to furnish seed so that other trees might grow. If they  wished to eat figs they had to say, &quot;O, fig tree, O, fig tree, please  give me a taste of your fruit;&quot; or, if they wished to eat oranges they  had to say, &quot;O, orange tree, O, orange tree, please give me a taste of  your fruit.&quot;
          In one corner of the garden grew the most splendid tree of all. It was  tall and beautiful and the rosy-cheeked fruit upon its wide spreading  branches looked wonderfully tempting. No beast had ever tasted of that  fruit, for no beast could ever remember its name.
          In a tiny house near the edge of the garden dwelt a little old woman  who knew the names of all the fruit trees which grew in the garden.  The beasts often went to her and asked the name of the wonderful fruit  tree, but the tree was so far distant from the tiny house of the  little old woman that no beast could ever remember the long, hard name  by the time he reached the fruit tree.
          At last the monkey thought of a trick. Perhaps you do not know it, but  the monkey can play the guitar. He always played when the beasts  gathered together in the garden to dance. The monkey went to the tiny  house of the little old woman, carrying his guitar under his arm. When  she told him the long hard name of the wonderful fruit tree he made up  a little tune to it, all his own, and sang it over and over again all  the way from the tiny house of the little old woman to the corner of  the garden where the wonderful fruit tree grew. When any of the other  beasts met him and asked him what new song he was singing to his  guitar, he said never a word. He marched straight on, playing his  little tune over and over again on his guitar and singing softly the  long hard name.
          At last he reached the corner of the garden where the wonderful fruit  tree grew. He had never seen it look so beautiful. The rosy-cheeked  fruit glowed in the bright sunlight. The monkey could hardly wait to  make his bow, say the long hard name over twice and ask for the fruit  with a &quot;please.&quot; What a beautiful colour and what a delicious odour  that fruit had! The monkey had never in all his life been so near to  anything which smelled so good. He took a big bite. What a face he  made! That beautiful sweet smelling fruit was bitter and sour, and it  had a nasty taste. He threw it away from him as far as he could.
          The monkey never forgot the tree's long hard name and the little tune  he had sung. Nor did he forget how the fruit tasted. He never took a  bite of it again; but, after that, his favourite trick was to treat  the other beasts to the wonderful fruit just to see them make faces  when they tasted it.
