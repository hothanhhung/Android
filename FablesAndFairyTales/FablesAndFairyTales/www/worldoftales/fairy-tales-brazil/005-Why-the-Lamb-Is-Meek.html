          Once upon a time there was a little lamb frisking gaily about the  pasture. The bright sunshine and the soft breezes made him very happy.  He had just finished a hearty meal and that made him happy too. He was  the very happiest little lamb in all the world and he thought that he  was the most wonderful little lamb.
          A big toad sat on the ground and watched him. After a while the toad  said: &quot;O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?&quot;
          The lamb replied that he had never felt better in all his life.
          &quot;Even though you are feeling very strong I can pull you into the sea,&quot;  said the toad.
          The little lamb laughed and laughed until he rolled over on the  ground.
          &quot;Just take hold of this rope and I'll show you how easy it is to pull  you into the sea,&quot; said the toad.
          The lamb took hold of the rope. Then the toad said, &quot;Please wait a  minute while I get a good long distance away from you. I can pull  better when I'm not too near you.&quot;
          The lamb waited and the toad hopped down to the sea. He hopped up into  a tree which hung over the water's edge and from there he hopped on to  the whale's back. He fastened the end of the rope around the whale  and then he called out to the lamb: &quot;All ready. Now we'll see how hard  you can pull.&quot;
          When the whale felt the lamb pulling at the rope he swam away from the  shore. No matter how hard the lamb pulled or how much force he exerted  it did not do one bit of good. He was dragged down to the water's edge  as easily as could be.
          &quot;I give up,&quot; said the lamb as he reached the water's edge.
          After that, although the sunshine was just as bright as ever, any one  who watched that little lamb could see that he was a little more meek.
          One day not long afterwards the sunshine was again very bright and the  little lamb was again feeling frisky. He was so happy and gay that he  had forgotten all about how the toad had pulled him down to the water  until the toad spoke to him. Then he remembered.
          &quot;O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?&quot; asked the toad. The  little lamb replied that he was very well.
          &quot;Let us run a race,&quot; said the toad, &quot;I think I can beat you.&quot;
          &quot;You may be strong enough to pull me into the sea,&quot; said the lamb,  &quot;but surely I can run faster than you. I've watched you hopping about  my pasture. You can't run fast at all. However, I'll gladly run a race  with you to prove what I say.&quot;
          The toad set a goal and told the lamb to call out every little while  during the race so he could see how much farther ahead the lamb was.  Then the toad and the lamb started.
          The toad had assembled all his brothers and his sisters and his  cousins and his uncles and his aunts before the race and had stationed  them at various points along the path of the race. He had told them  that whenever any of them should hear the lamb calling out, &quot;Laculay,  laculay, laculay,&quot; the toad which was nearest should answer,  &quot;Gulugubango, bango lay.&quot;
          The lamb ran and ran as fast as he could. Then he remembered his  promise and called out, &quot;Laculay, laculay, laculay.&quot; He expected to  hear the toad answer from a long, long distance behind him. He was  much surprised to hear some one near him answer, &quot;Gulugubango, bango  lay.&quot; After that he ran faster than ever.
          After running on for some distance farther the lamb again called out,  &quot;Laculay, laculay, laculay.&quot; Again he heard the answer at only a short  distance away, &quot;Gulugubango, bango lay.&quot; He ran and ran until his  little heart was beating so fast that it seemed as if it would burst.  At last he arrived at the goal of the race which the toad had set and  there sat the toad's brother who looked so much like him that the lamb  couldn't tell them apart. The lamb went back to his pasture very  meekly and quietly. He acknowledged that he had been beaten in the  race.
          The next morning the toad said to him, &quot;Even though you did not run  fast enough to win the race, still you are a very fast runner. I have  told the daughter of the king about you and I have said to her that  some day she shall see me riding on your back with a bridle in your  mouth as if you were my horse.&quot;
          The lamb was very angry. &quot;Perhaps you are strong enough to pull me  into the sea, and perhaps you can beat me when we run a race,&quot; said  the lamb, &quot;but never, never in the world will I be your horse.&quot;
          Time passed and the sunshine was very bright and the soft, gentle  breezes were very sweet. The lamb was so happy again that he forgot  all about how the toad had pulled him into the sea, and how the toad  had beaten him at running the race. He was very sorry for the toad  when he saw him all humped up in a disconsolate little heap one day.  &quot;O, poor toad, are you sick?&quot; he asked. &quot;Isn't there something I can  do to help you?&quot;
          The toad told him how very sick he was. &quot;There is something you could  do to help me,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don't believe that you are quite  strong enough or can travel quite fast enough.&quot;
          The lamb took a deep breath and blew out his chest. &quot;I'll show you,&quot;  he said. &quot;Just tell me what it is.&quot;
          The toad replied that he had promised to be at a party that afternoon  at the house of the king's daughter and he did not see how he could  possibly get there unless some one would carry him.
          &quot;Jump on my back,&quot; said the lamb. &quot;I'll carry you.&quot;
          The toad shook about on the lamb's back after they had started so that  it seemed as if he would surely fall off. After a little he said, &quot;I  can not possibly stand riding like this. It jars all my sore spots.  I'll have to get off.&quot; He tried it a little while longer and shook  about worse than ever. Then he said, &quot;Do you know, I think I could  endure this painful ride a little better if only I had something to  hold myself by? Do you mind if I take a piece of grass and put it in  your mouth? I can hold on to that when I shake about and my sore spots  will not hurt so much.&quot;
          The lamb let the toad put a piece of grass in his mouth.
          After a while the toad asked for a little stick. &quot;The flies and  mosquitoes annoy me terribly,&quot; he said. &quot;If only I had a little stick  I could wave it about over my head and frighten them away. It is very  bad for any one in my weak, nervous condition to be bothered by flies  and mosquitoes.&quot; The lamb let the toad have a little stick to wave  over his head.
          At last the lamb and the toad drew near to the palace of the king. The  king's daughter was leaning out of the window watching for them. The  toad dug his feet into the lamb's sides, pulled hard on the piece of  the grass in the lamb's mouth and waved the little stick about over  the lamb's head. &quot;Go on, horse,&quot; he said and the king's daughter heard  him. She laughed and laughed, and when all the rest of the people in  the palace saw the toad arriving mounted on the lamb's back and  driving him like a horse they laughed too. The lamb went meekly home  to his pasture and from that day to this when one wishes to speak of  meekness one says &quot;as meek as a lamb.&quot;
