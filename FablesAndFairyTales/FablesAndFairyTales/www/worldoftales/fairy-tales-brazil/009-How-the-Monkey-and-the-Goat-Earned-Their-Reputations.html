          Once upon a time the tiger sent an invitation to the goat asking the  goat to accompany him on a visit. The goat promptly accepted the  invitation and at the appointed day they started on their journey to  the house of the tiger's friend. On the way there they came to a  dangerous marsh. The tiger was afraid to cross it, but he pretended to  be very brave. He said to the goat: &quot;Friend Goat, how very pale you  look when you think about crossing the marsh. Don't be afraid. Just go  ahead.&quot;
          The goat assured the tiger that he was no coward. He thrust out his  chest and marched along toward the marsh like a brave soldier. As  soon, however, as he stepped into the marsh, he fell into the mud and  barely got through it alive. The tiger went around the marsh and  walked on dry ground.
          After the tiger and the goat had come together again they came to some  banana trees. The tiger said to the goat: &quot;Friend Goat, aren't you  hungry? Let us stop here and eat some bananas. You climb up and pluck  the bananas. Give me the ripe ones, and keep the green ones yourself.&quot;  The goat climbed up and picked the bananas. He gave the ripe ones to  the tiger and the tiger had a good meal. The goat went hungry.
          The tiger and the goat walked along and after going for some distance  they saw a cobra lying in the path. &quot;Friend Goat,&quot; said the tiger,  &quot;here you have the opportunity to procure a beautiful necklace for  your daughter, free of cost. Just pick it up and it is yours.&quot; The  goat started forward to pick up the snake, but the tiger told him to  let it alone if he did not want to be killed.
          When the tiger and the goat arrived at the house of the tiger's friend  it was very late. They soon went to bed in hammocks hung close  together. At midnight the tiger rose quietly, walked on tip toe to the  door, opened it, and went out. He hurried to the place where the sheep  were kept, killed the fattest lamb of the flock, and had a feast. Then  he went back to the hammock, wiped the blood on the goat, and went to  sleep.
          Early the next morning the host discovered that one of his lambs was  missing. He hastened to the room where the tiger and the goat were  sleeping and accused the tiger of having killed the lamb. The tiger  looked up at him with an innocent expression and asked, &quot;Do you see  any blood on me?&quot; There was no blood on the tiger, but the host looked  into the next hammock and saw the goat all covered with blood. &quot;I know  now who killed my fattest lamb,&quot; he said, and he gave the goat such a  beating that the poor goat barely escaped with his life. From that day  to this when one speaks of a person who has been easily imposed upon  he calls him &quot;the goat.&quot;
          Things happened very differently with the monkey. One day not long  afterward the tiger invited the monkey to accompany him when he went  to visit his friend. The monkey accepted, and the tiger and the monkey  set out on the journey. When they came to the marsh the tiger said to  the monkey, &quot;Friend Monkey, how very pale you look when you think  about crossing the marsh. Don't be afraid. Just go ahead.&quot;
          &quot;You go ahead yourself,&quot; replied the monkey. The tiger went through  the marsh and fell into the mud so that he was barely able to get out  again. The monkey went around the marsh and walked on dry ground.
          After a while the tiger and the monkey came to the banana trees.  &quot;Friend Monkey,&quot; said the tiger, &quot;aren't you hungry? Let us stop here  and eat some bananas. You climb up and pluck the bananas. Give the  ripe ones to me and you may keep the green ones for yourself.&quot; The  monkey climbed up and picked the bananas but he ate all the ripe ones  himself and threw the green ones down to the tiger. The tiger was  forced to go hungry but the monkey had a good meal.
          Finally the tiger and the monkey came to a cobra lying in the path.  &quot;Friend Monkey,&quot; said the tiger, &quot;here you have the opportunity to  procure a beautiful necklace for your daughter, free of cost. Pick it  up and it is yours.&quot;
          &quot;Pick it up yourself,&quot; replied the monkey.
          When the tiger and the monkey arrived at the house of the tiger's  friend it was very late. They went to bed in hammocks hung up close  together. The monkey had seen enough of the tiger that day to make him  decide that he had better sleep with one eye open. Accordingly he  pretended he was asleep, but he was really awake. At midnight he saw  the tiger crawl quietly out of his hammock, walk on tip toe to the  door, open it gently, and go out. The monkey decided to watch and see  what happened when the tiger came back.
          The tiger went to the place where the sheep were kept, killed the  fattest lamb of the flock and had a feast. When he came back he tried  to wipe the lamb's blood on the monkey. The monkey saw him and gave  him a push so that he spilled the blood all over himself and his own  hammock. Not a single drop went on the monkey.
          Early the next morning when the host missed one of his lambs he came  to the room where his guests were sleeping. He saw the tiger all  covered with blood and he cried, &quot;O ho, I have at last caught the one  who kills my lambs.&quot; Then he gave the tiger such a beating that he  barely escaped with his life. It was all he could do to crawl home  again.
