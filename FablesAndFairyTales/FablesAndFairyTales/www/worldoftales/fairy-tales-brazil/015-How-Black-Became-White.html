          One often hears the saying that one cannot make black white or white  black. I said something about it once upon a time to my Brazilian ama and she stared at me in surprise. &quot;O, yes, one can,&quot; she said.  &quot;It happened once and no one can ever tell but that it may happen  again. Perhaps the Senhora has not heard the story?&quot; I begged her to  tell me the story and this is the tale:
          Once upon a time there was a little old woman who lived all alone with  her little black son who was just as black as black can be. The little  old woman had not always lived alone with the little black boy. She  had once been the mother of three beautiful daughters, the very  loveliest maidens in all the country round. They were so handsome that  they attracted the attention of the wicked fairy who lived in an  enchanted castle nearby, and this fairy had been very jealous of them.  By the aid of magic she tied them up in sacks which could be opened  only by burning the sacks over a fire built from magic wood. The  little old woman and her little black son searched long and diligently  for magic wood, but they were never able to find any.
          It was a terrible thing to have one's daughters shut up in magic  sacks. The little old woman had grown bent and weak and cross in her  search to find the magic wood. If it had not been for the little black boy she would have given up entirely. The little black boy was  always gay and cheerful and always sure that some day they would  succeed in finding the magic wood.
          One day the little old woman took her big water jar upon her head and  carried it down to the stream to fill. It was so very heavy when she  had filled it with water that she could not lift it to her head even  with the help of the little black boy. Three fine looking cavalheiros happened to be passing on horseback. She sent the little  black boy to ask them if they would help her. They said they couldn't  possibly stop. The little old woman was very angry. She did not know  that they were on their way to the magic castle and couldn't stop.  The same wicked fairy who had shut the little old woman's beautiful  daughters up in the sacks, was leading them on.
          If the little old woman had known all about the three cavalheiros she would not have been angry. She would have wanted to help them  instead. The three cavalheiros were very good and very wise, so they  managed to get along very well. As soon as they reached the enchanted  castle the fairy showed them to their beds. She had marked each bed  with a candle. No one before had ever been wise enough to blow out  these candles. These cavalheiros blew out the candles and that took  away the fairy's power over them. They were able to escape from the  palace. When the wicked fairy came to put them in her magic sacks she  found the beds empty.
          The three cavalheiros took their horses and rode back by the same  road by which they had come. They stopped at a little shop on a corner  which was kept by a good fairy and bought one vintem's worth of  ashes, one vintem's worth of salt and one vintem's worth of pins.
          After a while the three cavalheiros approached the house of the  little old woman and the little black boy. The little old woman was  still angry because they had refused to stop and help her lift her  water jar to her head. When she saw them coming she threw stones at  them. Of course that was a very stupid thing to do.
          When the three cavalheiros saw what was happening they were greatly  surprised. They had forgotten all about the little black boy and the  little old woman whom he had asked them to help. When they saw her  coming with the stones they thought that she must be a wicked fairy in  the form of a little old woman.
          The cavalheiro who had one vintem's worth of ashes in his pocket  threw the ashes at her. It became night. The little old woman came on  with her stones just the same.
          The cavalheiro who had one vintem's worth of salt in his pocket  threw the salt at her. Immediately a sea of salt water appeared  between the three cavalheiros and the little old woman. The little  old woman came on with her stones just the same.
          The cavalheiro who had one vintem's worth of pins in his pocket  threw the pins at her. Immediately a high, thorny hedge sprang out of  the ground between the little old woman and the three cavalheiros.
          The little old woman was too angry to think clearly. If she had not  been so angry she would have known at once that this must be magic  wood. The little black boy, however, had his wits about him. He  hastened to gather the branches even though the thorns tore his hands.  Soon he had brought together a great pile of wood like the piles which  they make in the streets to burn on a festa night.
          The little old woman saw what he was doing and ran to get the magic  sacks in which her daughters were imprisoned. They laid the sacks on  top of the pile of magic wood and lighted the fire. There was a great  noise like thunder. Out of the three magic sacks there sprang three  beautiful maidens who had been preserved alive in the sacks by a  miracle of Nossa Senhora.
          The little old woman and her three beautiful daughters turned to thank  the little black boy for what he had done. The little black boy was no  longer black. He had been turned white.
          The three cavalheiros married the three beautiful maidens and the  little boy who was now white, grew up to be the greatest cavalheiro of them all.
