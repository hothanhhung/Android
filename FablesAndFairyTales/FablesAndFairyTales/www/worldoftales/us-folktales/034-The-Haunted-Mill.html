          Among the settlers in the Adirondacks, forty or fifty years ago, was  Henry Clymer, from Brooklyn, who went up to Little Black Creek and tried  to make a farm out of the gnarly, stumpy land; but being a green hand at  that sort of thing, he soon gave it up and put up the place near  Northwood, that is locally referred to as the haunted mill. When the  first slab was cut, a big party was on hand to cheer and eat pie in honor  of the Clymers, for Mr. Clymer, who was a dark, hearty, handsome fellow,  and his bright young wife had been liberal in their hospitality. The  couple had made some talk, they were so loving before folks&mdash;too loving  to last; and, besides, it was evident that Mrs. Clymer was used to a  better station in life than her husband. It was while the crowd was  laughing and chattering at the picnic-table of new boards from the mill  that Mrs. Clymer stole away to her modest little house, and a neighbor  who had followed her was an accidental witness to a singular episode.  Mrs. Clymer was kneeling beside her bed, crying over the picture of a  child, when Clymer entered unexpectedly and attempted to take the picture  from her.
          She faced him defiantly. &quot;You kept that because it looked like him, I  reckon,&quot; he said. &quot;You might run back to him. You know what he'd call you  and where you'd stand with your aristocracy.&quot;
          The woman pointed to the door, and the man left without another word, and  so did the listener. Next morning the body of Mrs. Clymer was found  hanging to a beam in the mill. At the inquest the husband owned that he  had &quot;had a few words&quot; with her on the previous day, and thought that she  must have suddenly become insane. The jury took this view. News of the  suicide was printed in some of the city papers, and soon after that the  gossips had another sensation, for a fair-haired man, also from Brooklyn,  arrived at the place and asked where the woman was buried. When he found  the grave he sat beside it for some time, his head resting on his hand;  then he inquired for Clymer, but Clymer, deadly pale, had gone into the  woods as soon as he heard that a stranger had arrived. The new-comer went  to Trenton, where he ordered a gravestone bearing the single word  &quot;Estella&quot; to be placed where the woman's body had been interred. Clymer  quickly sold out and disappeared. The mill never prospered, and has long  been in a ruinous condition. People of the neighborhood think that the  ghost of Mrs. Clymer&mdash;was that her name?&mdash;still troubles it, and they  pass the place with quickened steps.
