Behind the New Grand Hotel, in the Catskills, is an amphitheatre of  mountain that is held to be the place of which the Mohicans spoke when  they told of people there who worked in metals, and had bushy beards and  eyes like pigs. From the smoke of their forges, in autumn, came the haze  of Indian summer; and when the moon was full, it was their custom to  assemble on the edge of a precipice above the hollow and dance and caper  until the night was nigh worn away. They brewed a liquor that had the  effect of shortening the bodies and swelling the heads of all who drank  it, and when Hudson and his crew visited the mountains, the pygmies held  a carouse in his honor and invited him to drink their liquor. The crew  went away, shrunken and distorted by the magic distillation, and thus it  was that Rip Van Winkle found them on the eve of his famous sleep.
