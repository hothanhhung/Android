          It was noised about New Amsterdam, two hundred years ago, that a round  and bulky ship flying Dutch colors from her lofty quarter was careering  up the harbor in the teeth of a north wind, through the swift waters of  an ebbing tide, and making for the Hudson. A signal from the Battery to  heave to and account for herself being disregarded, a cannon was trained  upon her, and a ball went whistling through her cloudy and imponderable  mass, for timbers she had none. Some of the sailor-folk talked of mirages  that rose into the air of northern coasts and seas, but the wise ones put  their fingers beside their noses and called to memory the Flying  Dutchman, that wanderer of the seas whose captain, having sworn that he  would round Cape Horn in spite of heaven and hell, has been beating to  and fro along the bleak Fuegian coast and elsewhere for centuries, being  allowed to land but once in seven years, when he can break the curse if  he finds a girl who will love him. Perhaps Captain Vanderdecken found  this maiden of his hopes in some Dutch settlement on the Hudson, or  perhaps he expiated his rashness by prayer and penitence; howbeit, he  never came down again, unless he slipped away to sea in snow or fog so  dense that watchers and boatmen saw nothing of his passing. A few old  settlers declared the vessel to be the Half Moon, and there were some who  testified to seeing that identical ship with Hudson and his spectre crew  on board making for the Catskills to hold carouse.
          This fleeting vision has been confounded with the storm ship that lurks  about the foot of the Palisades and Point-no-Point, cruising through  Tappan Zee at night when a gale is coming up. The Hudson is four miles  wide at Tappan, and squalls have space enough to gather force; hence,  when old skippers saw the misty form of a ship steal out from the shadows  of the western hills, then fly like a gull from shore to shore, catching  the moonlight on her topsails, but showing no lanterns, they made to  windward and dropped anchor, unless their craft were stanch and their  pilot's brains unvexed with liquor. On summer nights, when falls that  curious silence which is ominous of tempest, the storm ship is not only  seen spinning across the mirror surface of the river, but the voices of  the crew are heard as they chant at the braces and halyards in words  devoid of meaning to the listeners.
