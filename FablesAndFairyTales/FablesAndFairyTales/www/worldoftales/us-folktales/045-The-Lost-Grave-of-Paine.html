Failure to mark the resting-places of great men and to indicate the  scenes of their deeds has led to misunderstanding and confusion among  those who discover a regard for history and tradition in this practical  age. Robert Fulton, who made steam navigation possible, lies in an  unmarked tomb in the yard of Trinity Church&mdash;the richest church in  America. The stone erected to show where Andre was hanged was destroyed  by a cheap patriot, who thought it represented a compliment to the spy.  The spot where Alexander Hamilton was shot in the duel by Aaron Burr is  known to few and will soon be forgotten. It was not until a century of  obloquy had been heaped on the memory of Thomas Paine that his once  enemies were brought to know him as a statesman of integrity, a  philanthropist, and philosopher. His deistic religion, proclaimed in &quot;The  Age of Reason,&quot; is unfortunately no whit more independent than is  preached in dozens of pulpits to-day. He died ripe in honors, despite his  want of creed, and his mortal part was buried in New Rochelle, New York,  under a large walnut-tree in a hay-field. Some years later his friends  removed the body to a new grave in higher ground, and placed over it a  monument that the opponents of his principles quickly hacked to pieces.  Around the original grave there still remains a part of the old  inclosure, and it was proposed to erect a suitable memorial&mdash;the Hudson  and its Hills the spot, but the owner of the tract would neither give nor  sell an inch of his land for the purpose of doing honor to the man. Some  doubt has already been expressed as to whether the grave is beneath the  monument or in the inclosure; and it is also asserted that Paine's ghost  appears at intervals, hovering in the air between the two burial-places,  or flitting back and forth from one to the other, lamenting the  forgetfulness of men and wailing, &quot;Where is my grave? I have lost my  grave!&quot;
