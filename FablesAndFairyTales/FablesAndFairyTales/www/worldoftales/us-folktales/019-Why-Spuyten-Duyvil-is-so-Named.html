          The tide-water creek that forms the upper boundary of Manhattan Island is  known to dwellers in tenements round about as &quot;Spittin' Divvle.&quot; The  proper name of it is Spuyten Duyvil, and this, in turn, is the  compression of a celebrated boast by Anthony Van Corlaer. This  redoubtable gentleman, famous for fat, long wind, and long whiskers, was  trumpeter for the garrison at New Amsterdam, which his countrymen had  just bought for twenty-four dollars, and he sounded the brass so sturdily  that in the fight between the Dutch and Indians at the Dey Street peach  orchard his blasts struck more terror into the red men's hearts than did  the matchlocks of his comrades. William the Testy vowed that Anthony and  his trumpet were garrison enough for all Manhattan Island, for he argued  that no regiment of Yankees would approach near enough to be struck with  lasting deafness, as must have happened if they came when Anthony was  awake.
          Peter Stuyvesant-Peter the Headstrong&mdash;showed his appreciation of  Anthony's worth by making him his esquire, and when he got news of an  English expedition on its way to seize his unoffending colony, he at once  ordered Anthony to rouse the villages along the Hudson with a trumpet  call to war. The esquire took a hurried leave of six or eight ladies,  each of whom delighted to believe that his affections were lavished on  her alone, and bravely started northward, his trumpet hanging on one  side, a stone bottle, much heavier, depending from the other. It was a  stormy evening when he arrived at the upper end of the island, and there  was no ferryman in sight, so, after fuming up and down the shore, he  swallowed a mighty draught of Dutch courage,&mdash;for he was as accomplished  a performer on the horn as on the trumpet,&mdash;and swore with ornate and  voluminous oaths that he would swim the stream &quot;in spite of the devil&quot;  [En spuyt den Duyvil].
          He plunged in, and had gone half-way across when the Evil One, not to be  spited, appeared as a huge moss-bunker, vomiting boiling water and  lashing a fiery tail. This dreadful fish seized Anthony by the leg; but  the trumpeter was game, for, raising his instrument to his lips, he  exhaled his last breath through it in a defiant blast that rang through  the woods for miles and made the devil himself let go for a moment. Then  he was dragged below, his nose shining through the water more and more  faintly, until, at last, all sight of him was lost. The failure of his  mission resulted in the downfall of the Dutch in America, for, soon  after, the English won a bloodless victory, and St. George's cross  flaunted from the ramparts where Anthony had so often saluted the setting  sun. But it was years, even then, before he was hushed, for in stormy  weather it was claimed that the shrill of his trumpet could be heard near  the creek that he had named, sounding above the deeper roar of the blast.
