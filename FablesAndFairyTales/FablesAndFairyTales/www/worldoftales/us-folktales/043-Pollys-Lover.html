          In about the middle of this century a withered woman of ninety was buried  from a now deserted house in White Plains, New York, Polly Carter the  name of her, but &quot;Crazy Polly&quot; was what the neighbors called her, for she  was eccentric and not fond of company. Among the belongings of her house  was a tall clock, such as relic hunters prize, that ticked solemnly in a  landing on the stairs.
          For a time, during the Revolution, the house stood within the British  lines, and as her father was a colonel in Washington's army she was left  almost alone in it. The British officers respected her sex, but they had  an unpleasant way of running in unannounced and demanding entertainment,  in the king's name, which she felt forced to grant. One rainy afternoon  the door was flung open, then locked on the inside, and she found herself  in the arms of a stalwart, handsome lieutenant, who wore the blue. It was  her cousin and fiance. Their glad talk had not been going long when there  came a rousing summons at the door. Three English officers were awaiting  admittance.
          Perhaps they had seen Lawrence Carter go into the house, and if caught he  would be killed as a spy. He must be hidden, but in some place where they  would not think of looking. The clock! That was the place. With a laugh  and a kiss the young man submitted to be shut in this narrow quarter, and  throwing his coat and hat behind some furniture the girl admitted the  officers, who were wet and surly and demanded dinner. They tramped about  the best room in their muddy boots, talking loudly, and in order to break  the effect of the chill weather they passed the brandy bottle freely.  Polly served them with a dinner as quickly as possible, for she wanted to  get them out of the house, but they were in no mood to go, and the bottle  passed so often that before the dinner was over they were noisy and tipsy  and were using language that drove Polly from the room.
          At last, to her relief, she heard them preparing to leave the house, but  as they were about to go the senior officer, looking up at the landing,  now dim in the paling light, said to one of the others, &quot;See what time it  is.&quot; The officer addressed, who happened to be the drunkest of the party,  staggered up the stair and exclaimed, &quot;The d&mdash;-d thing's stopped.&quot; Then,  as if he thought it a good joke, he added, &quot;It'll never go again.&quot;  Drawing his sabre he gave the clock a careless cut and ran the blade  through the panel of the door; after this the three passed out. When  their voices had died in distant brawling, Polly ran to release her  lover. Something thick and dark was creeping from beneath the clock-case.  With trembling fingers she pulled open the door, and Lawrence, her lover,  fell heavily forward into her arms, dead. The officer was right: the  clock never went again.
