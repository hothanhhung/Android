A number of their graves were to  be seen until within fifty years, as clearly marked as when the warriors  were laid there in the hope of resurrection among the happy hunting  grounds that lay to the west and south. The casting of stones on the  death-spots or graves of some revered or beloved Indians was long  continued, and was undoubtedly for the purpose of raising monuments to  them, though at Monument Mountain, Massachusetts, Sacrifice Rock, between  Plymouth and Sandwich, Massachusetts, and some other places the cairns  merely mark a trail. Even the temporary resting-place of Sachem  Poggatacut, near Sag Harbor, was kept clear of weeds and leaves by  Indians who passed it in the two centuries that lapsed between the death  of the chief and the laying of the road across it in 1846. This spot is  not far from Whooping Boy's Hollow, so named because of a boy who was  killed by Indians, and because the rubbing of two trees there in a storm  gave forth a noise like crying. An older legend has it that this noise is  the angry voice of the magician who tried to slay Wyandank, the  &quot;Washington of the Montauks,&quot; who is buried on the east end of the  island. Often he led his men into battle, sounding the warwhoop, copied  from the scream of the eagle, so loudly that those who heard it said that  the Montauks were crying for prey.
          It was while killing an eagle on Block Island, that he might use the  plumes for his hair, that this chief disclosed himself to the hostiles  and brought on a fight in which every participant except himself was  slain. He was secretly followed back to Long Island by a magician who had  hopes of enlisting the evil ones of that region against him,&mdash;the giants  that left their tracks in &quot;Blood-stone Rock&quot; and &quot;Printed Rock,&quot; near  Napeague, and such renegades as he who, having betrayed his people, was  swallowed by the earth, his last agony being marked by a stamp of the  foot that left its print on a slab near the Indian burial-ground at  Kongonok. Failing in these alliances the wizard hid among the hollows of  the moors, and there worked spells of such malice that the chief's hand  lost steadiness in the hunt and his voice was seldom heard in council.  When the haunt of this evil one was made known, a number of young men  undertook to trap him. They went to the hills by night, and moved  stealthily through the shrubbery until they were almost upon him; but his  familiars had warned him of their approach, though they had wakened him  only to betray him for a cloud swept in from the sea, fell about the  wretch, burst into flame, and rolled back toward the ocean, bearing him  in the centre of its burning folds. Because of the cry he uttered the  place long bore the name of Whooping Hollow, and it used to be said that  the magician visited the scene of his ill-doing every winter, when his  shrieks could be heard ringing over the hills.
