          At Carthage, New York, where the Black River bends gracefully about a  point, there was a stanch old house, built in the colonial fashion and  designed for the occupancy of some family of hospitality and wealth, but  the family died out or moved away, and for some years it remained  deserted. During the war of 1812 the village gossips were excited by the  appearance of carpenters, painters and upholsterers, and it was evident  that the place was to be restored to its manorial dignities; but their  curiosity was deepened instead of satisfied when, after the house had  been put in order and high walls built around it, the occupants presented  themselves as four young women in the garb of nuns. Were they daughters  of the family? Were they English sympathizers in disguise, seeking asylum  in the days of trouble? Had they registered a vow of celibacy until their  lovers should return from the war? Were they on a secret and diplomatic  errand? None ever knew, at least in Carthage. The nuns lived in great  privacy, but in a luxury before unequalled in that part of the country.  They kept a gardener, they received from New York wines and delicacies  that others could not afford, and when they took the air, still veiled,  it was behind a splendid pair of bays.
          One afternoon, just after the close of the war, a couple of young  American officers went to the convent, and, contrary to all precedent,  were admitted. They remained within all that day, and no one saw them  leave, but a sound of wheels passed through the street that evening. Next  day there were no signs of life about the place, nor the day following,  nor the next. The savage dog was quiet and the garden walks had gone  unswept. Some neighbors climbed over the wall and reported that the place  had been deserted. Why and by whom no one ever knew, but a cloud remained  upon its title until a recent day, for it was thought that at some time  the nuns might return.
