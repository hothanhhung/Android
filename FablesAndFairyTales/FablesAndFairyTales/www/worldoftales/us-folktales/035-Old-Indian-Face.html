          On Lower Ausable Pond is a large, ruddy rock showing a huge profile, with  another, resembling a pappoose, below it. When the Tahawi ruled this  region their sachem lived here at &quot;the Dark Cup,&quot; as they called this  lake, a man renowned for virtue and remarkable, in his age, for  gentleness. When his children had died and his manly grandson, who was  the old man's hope, had followed them to the land of the cloud mountains,  Adota's heart withered within him, and standing beneath this rock, he  addressed his people, recounting what he had done for them, how he had  swept their enemies from the Lakes of the Clustered Stars (the Lower  Saranac) and Silver Sky (Upper Saranac) to the Lake of Wandah, gaining a  land where they might hunt and fish in peace. The little one, the Star,  had been ravished away to crown the brow of the thunder god, who, even  now, was advancing across the peaks, bending the woods and lighting the  valleys with his jagged torches.
          Life was nothing to him longer; he resigned it.
          As he spoke these words he fell back, and the breath passed out of him.  Then came the thunder god, and with an appalling burst of fire sent the  people cowering. The roar that followed seemed to shake the earth, but  the medicine-man of the tribe stood still, listening to the speech of the  god in the clouds. &quot;Tribe of the Tahawi,&quot; he translated, &quot;Adota treads  the star-path to the happy hunting-grounds, and the sun is shining on his  heart. He will never walk among you again, but the god loves both him and  you, and he will set his face on the mountains. Look!&quot; And, raising their  eyes, they beheld the likeness of Adota and of his beloved child, the  Star, graven by lightning-stroke on the cliff. There they buried the body  of Adota and held their solemn festivals until the white men drove them  out of the country.
