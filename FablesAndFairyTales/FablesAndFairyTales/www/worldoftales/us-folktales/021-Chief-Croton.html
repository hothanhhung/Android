          Between the island of Manhattoes and the Catskills the Hudson shores were  plagued with spooks, and even as late as the nineteenth century Hans  Anderson, a man who tilled a farm back of Peekskill, was worried into his  grave by the leaden-face likeness of a British spy whom he had hanged on  General Putnam's orders. &quot;Old Put&quot; doubtless enjoyed immunity from this  vexatious creature, because he was born with few nerves. A region  especially afflicted was the confluence of the Croton and the Hudson, for  the Kitchawan burying-ground was here, and the red people being disturbed  by the tramping of white men over their graves, &quot;the walking sachems of  Teller's Point&quot; were nightly to be met on their errands of protest.
          These Indians had built a palisade on Croton Point, and here they made  their last stand against their enemies from the north. Throughout the  fight old chief Croton stood on the wall with arrows showering around  him, and directed the resistance with the utmost calm. Not until every  one of his men was dead and the fort was going up in flame about him did  he confess defeat. Then standing amid the charring timbers, he used his  last breath in calling down the curse of the Great Spirit against the  foe. As the victorious enemy rushed into the enclosure to secure the  scalps of the dead he fell lifeless into the fire, and their jubilant  yell was lost upon his ears. Yet, he could not rest nor bear to leave his  ancient home, even after death, and often his form, in musing attitude,  was seen moving through the woods. When a manor was built on the ruins of  his fort, he appeared to the master of it, to urge him into the  Continental army, and having seen this behest obeyed and laid a solemn  injointure to keep the freedom of the land forever, he vanished, and  never appeared again.
