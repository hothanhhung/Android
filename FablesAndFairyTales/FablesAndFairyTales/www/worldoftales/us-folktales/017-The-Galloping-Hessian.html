          In the flower-gemmed cemetery of Tarrytown, where gentle Irving sleeps, a  Hessian soldier was interred after sustaining misfortune in the loss of  his head in one of the Revolutionary battles. For a long time after he  was buried it was the habit of this gentleman to crawl from his grave at  unseemly hours and gallop about the country, sending shivers through the  frames of many worthy people, who shrank under their blankets when they  heard the rush of hoofs along the unlighted roads.
          In later times there lived in Tarrytown&mdash;so named because of the tarrying  habits of Dutch gossips on market days, though some hard-minded people  insist that Tarwe-town means Wheat-towna gaunt schoolmaster, one Ichabod  Crane, who cherished sweet sentiments for Katrina Van Tassell, the buxom  daughter of a farmer, also a famous maker of pies and doughnuts. Ichabod  had been calling late one evening, and, his way home being long,  Katrina's father lent him a horse to make the journey; but even with this  advantage the youth set out with misgivings, for he had to pass the  graveyard.
          As it was near the hour when the Hessian was to ride, he whistled feebly  to keep his courage up, but when he came to the dreaded spot the whistle  died in a gasp, for he heard the tread of a horse. On looking around, his  hair bristled and his heart came up like a plug in his throat to hinder  his breathing, for he saw a headless horseman coming over the ridge  behind him, blackly defined against the starry sky. Setting spurs to his  nag with a hope of being first to reach Sleepy Hollow bridge, which the  spectre never passed, the unhappy man made the best possible time in that  direction, for his follower was surely overtaking him. Another minute and  the bridge would be reached; but, to Ichabod's horror, the Hessian dashed  alongside and, rising in his stirrups, flung his head full at the  fugitive's back. With a squeal of fright the schoolmaster rolled into a  mass of weeds by the wayside, and for some minutes he remained there,  knowing and remembering nothing.
          Next morning farmer Van Tassell's horse was found grazing in a field near  Sleepy Hollow, and a man who lived some miles southward reported that he  had seen Mr. Crane striding as rapidly along the road to New York as his  lean legs could take him, and wearing a pale and serious face as he kept  his march. There were yellow stains on the back of his coat, and the man  who restored the horse found a smashed pumpkin in the broken bushes  beside the road. Ichabod never returned to Tarrytown, and when Brom  Bones, a stout young ploughman and taphaunter, married Katrina, people  made bold to say that he knew more about the galloping Hessian than any  one else, though they believed that he never had reason to be jealous of  Ichabod Crane.
