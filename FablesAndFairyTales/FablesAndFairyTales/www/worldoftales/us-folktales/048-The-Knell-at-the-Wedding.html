The elderly man was rich. After the  first paroxysm of rage and disappointment had passed, the lover withdrew  from the world and devoted himself to study; nor when he learned that she  had become a widow, with comfortable belongings derived from the estate  of the late lamented, did he renew acquaintance with her, and he smiled  bitterly when he heard of her second marriage to a young adventurer who  led her a wretched life, but atoned for his sins, in a measure, by dying  soon enough afterward to leave a part of her fortune unspent.
          In the lapse of time the doubly widowed returned to New York, where she  met again the lover of her youth. Mr. Ellenwood had acquired the reserve  of a scholar, and had often puzzled his friends with his eccentricities;  but after a few meetings with the object of his young affection he came  out of his glooms, and with respectful formality laid again at her feet  the heart she had trampled on forty years before. Though both of them  were well on in life, the news of their engagement made little of a  sensation. The widow was still fair; the wooer was quiet, refined, and  courtly, and the union of their fortunes would assure a competence for  the years that might be left to them. The church of St. Paul, on  Broadway, was appointed for the wedding, and it was a whim of the groom  that his bride should meet him there. At the appointed hour a company of  the curious had assembled in the edifice; a rattle of wheels was heard,  and a bevy of bridesmaids and friends in hoop, patch, velvet, silk,  powder, swords, and buckles walked down the aisle; but just as the bride  had come within the door, out of the sunlight that streamed so  brilliantly on the mounded turf and tombstones in the churchyard, the  bell in the steeple gave a single boom.
          The bride walked to the altar, and as she took her place before it  another clang resounded from the belfry. The bridegroom was not there.  Again and again the brazen throat and iron tongue sent out a doleful  knell, and faces grew pale and anxious, for the meaning of it could not  be guessed. With eyes fixed on the marble tomb of her first husband, the  woman tremblingly awaited the solution of the mystery, until the door was  darkened by something that made her catch her breath&mdash;a funeral. The  organ began a solemn dirge as a black-cloaked cortege came through the  aisle, and it was with amazement that the bride discovered it to be  formed of her oldest friends,&mdash;bent, withered; paired, man and woman, as  in mockery&mdash;while behind, with white face, gleaming eyes, disordered  hair, and halting step, came the bridegroom, in his shroud.
          &quot;Come,&quot; he said,&mdash;&quot;let us be married. The coffins are ready. Then, home to  the tomb.&quot;
          &quot;Cruel!&quot; murmured the woman.
        &quot;Now, Heaven judge which of us has been cruel. Forty years ago you took  away my faith, destroyed my hopes, and gave to others your youth and  beauty. Our lives have nearly run their course, so I am come to wed you  as with funeral rites.&quot; Then, in a softer manner, he took her hand, and  said, &quot;All is forgiven. If we cannot live together we will at least be  wedded in death. Time is almost at its end. We will marry for eternity.  Come.&quot; And tenderly embracing her, he led her forward. Hard as was the  ordeal, confusing, frightening, humiliating, the bride came through it a  better woman.
          &quot;It is true,&quot; she said, &quot;I have been vain and worldly, but now, in my  age, the truest love I ever knew has come back to me. It is a holy love.  I will cherish it forever.&quot; Their eyes met, and they saw each other  through tears. Solemnly the clergyman read the marriage service, and when  it was concluded the low threnody that had come from the organ in key  with the measured clang of the bell, merged into a nobler motive, until  at last the funeral measures were lost in a burst of exultant harmony.  Sobs of pent feeling and sighs of relief were heard as the bridal party  moved away, and when the newmade wife and husband reached the portal the  bell was silent and the sun was shining.
