          It is unthinkingly said and often, that America is not old enough to have  developed a legendary era, for such an era grows backward as a nation  grows forward. No little of the charm of European travel is ascribed to  the glamour that history and fable have flung around old churches,  castles, and the favored haunts of tourists, and the Rhine and Hudson are  frequently compared, to the prejudice of the latter, not because its  scenery lacks in loveliness or grandeur, but that its beauty has not been  humanized by love of chivalry or faerie, as that of the older stream has  been. Yet the record of our country's progress is of deep import, and as  time goes on the figures seen against the morning twilight of our history  will rise to more commanding stature, and the mists of legend will invest  them with a softness or glory that shall make reverence for them  spontaneous and deep. Washington hurling the stone across the Potomac may  live as the Siegfried of some Western saga, and Franklin invoking the  lightnings may be the Loki of our mythology. The bibliography of American  legends is slight, and these tales have been gathered from sources the  most diverse: records, histories, newspapers, magazines, oral  narrative&mdash;in every case reconstructed. The pursuit of them has been so  long that a claim may be set forth for some measure of completeness.
          But, whatever the episodes of our four historic centuries may furnish to  the poet, painter, dramatist, or legend-building idealist of the future,  it is certain that we are not devoid of myth and folk-lore. Some  characters, prosaic enough, perhaps, in daily life, have impinged so  lightly on society before and after perpetrating their one or two great  deeds, that they have already become shadowy and their achievements have  acquired a color of the supernatural. It is where myth and history  combine that legend is most interesting and appeals to our fancy or our  sympathy most strongly; and it is not too early for us to begin the  collation of those quaint happenings and those spoken reports that gain  in picturesqueness with each transmission. An attempt has been made in  this instance to assemble only legends, for, doubtful as some historians  profess to find them, certain occurrences, like the story of Captain  Smith and Pocahontas, and the ride of General Putnam down Breakneck  Stairs, are taught as history; while as to folk-lore, that of the Indian  tribes and of the Southern negro is too copious to be recounted in this  work. It will be noted that traditions do not thrive in brick and  brownstone, and that the stories once rife in the colonial cities have  almost as effectually disappeared as the architectural landmarks of last  century. The field entered by the writer is not untrodden. Hawthorne and  Irving have made paths across it, and it is hoped that others may deem  its farther exploration worthy of their efforts.
