          It was at Palmyra, New York, that the principles of Mormonism were first  enunciated by Joseph Smith, who claimed to have found the golden plates  of the Book of Mormon in a hill-side in neighboring Manchester,&mdash;the  &quot;Hill of Cumorah,&quot;&mdash;to which he was led by angels. The plates were  written in characters similar to the masonic cabala, and he translated  them by divine aid, giving to the world the result of his discovery. The  Hebrew prophet Mormon was the alleged author of the record, and his son  Moroni buried it. The basis of Mormonism was, however, an unpublished  novel, called &quot;The Manuscript Found,&quot; that was read to Sidney Rigdon  (afterwards a Mormon elder) by its author, a clergyman, and that  formulated a creed for a hypothetical church. Smith had a slight local  celebrity, for he and his father were operators with the divining-rod,  and when he appropriated this creed a harmless and beneficent one, for  polygamy was a later &quot;inspiration&quot; of Brigham Young&mdash;and began to preach  it, in 1844, it gained many converts. His arrogation of the presidency of  the &quot;Church of Latter Day Saints&quot; and other rash performances won for him  the enmity of the Gentiles, who imprisoned and killed him at Carthage,  Missouri, leaving Brigham Young to lead the people across the deserts to  Salt Lake, where they prospered through thrift and industry.
          It was claimed that in the van of this army, on the march to Utah, was  often seen a venerable man with silver beard, who never spoke, but who  would point the way whenever the pilgrims were faint or discouraged. When  they reached the spot where the temple was afterwards built, he struck  his staff into the earth and vanished.
          At Hydesville, near Palmyra, spiritualism, as it is commonly called, came  into being on March 31, 1849, when certain of the departed announced  themselves by thumping on doors and tables in the house of the Fox  family, the survivors of which confessed the fraud nearly forty years  after. It is of interest to note that the ground whence these new  religions sprang was peopled by the Onondagas, the sacerdotal class of  the Algonquin tribe, who have preserved the ancient religious rites of  that great family until this day.
