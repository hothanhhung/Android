          In the middle of the last century a large body of Saranac Indians  occupied the forests of the Upper Saranac through which ran the Indian  carrying-place, called by them the Eagle Nest Trail. Whenever they raided  the Tahawi on the slopes of Mount Tahawus (Sky-splitter), there was a  pleasing rivalry between two young athletes, called the Wolf and the  Eagle, as to which would carry off the more scalps, and the tribe was  divided in admiration of them. There was one who did not share this  liking: an old sachem, one of the wizards who had escaped when the Great  Spirit locked these workers of evil in the hollow trees that stood beside  the trail. In their struggles to escape the less fortunate ones thrust  their arms through the closing bark, and they are seen there, as withered  trunks and branches, to this day. Oquarah had not been softened by this  exhibition of danger nor the qualification of mercy that allowed him  still to exist. Rather he was more bitter when he saw, as he fancied,  that the tribe thought more of the daring and powerful warriors than it  did of the bent and malignant-minded counsellor.
          It was in the moon of green leaves that the two young men set off to hunt  the moose, and on the next day the Wolf returned alone. He explained that  in the hunt they had been separated; he had called for hours for his  friend, and had searched so long that he concluded he must have returned  ahead of him. But he was not at the camp. Up rose the sachem with visage  dark. &quot;I hear a forked tongue,&quot; he cried. &quot;The Wolf was jealous of the  Eagle and his teeth have cut into his heart.&quot;
          &quot;The Wolf cannot lie,&quot; answered the young man.
          &quot;Where is the Eagle?&quot; angrily shouted the sachem, clutching his hatchet.
          &quot;The Wolf has said,&quot; replied the other.
          The old sachem advanced upon him, but as he raised his axe to strike, the  wife of the Wolf threw herself before her husband, and the steel sank  into her brain. The sachem fell an instant later with the Wolf's knife in  his heart, and instantly the camp was in turmoil. Before the day had  passed it had been broken up, and the people were divided into factions,  for it was no longer possible to hold it together in peace. The Wolf,  with half of the people, went down the Sounding River to new  hunting-grounds, and the earth that separated the families was reddened  whenever one side met the other.
          Years had passed when, one morning, the upper tribe saw a canoe advancing  across the Lake of the Silver Sky. An old man stepped from it: he was the  Eagle. After the Wolf had left him he had fallen into a cleft in a rock,  and had lain helpless until found by hunters who were on their way to  Canada. He had joined the British against the French, had married a  northern squaw, but had returned to die among the people of his early  love. Deep was his sorrow that his friend should have been accused of  doing him an injury, and that the once happy tribe should have been  divided by that allegation. The warriors and sachems of both branches  were summoned to a council, and in his presence they swore a peace, so  that in the fulness of time he was able to die content. That peace was  always kept.
