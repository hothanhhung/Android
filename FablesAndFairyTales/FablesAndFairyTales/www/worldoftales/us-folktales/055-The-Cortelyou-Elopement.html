It was in one of these forays on pigs and chickens that a  gallant officer of red-coats met a pretty lass in the fields of  Cortelyou. He stilled her alarm by aiding her to gather wild-flowers, and  it came about that the girl often went into the fields and came back with  prodigious bouquets of daisies. The elder Cortelyou had no inkling of  this adventure until one of his sons saw her tryst with the red-coat at a  distance. Be sure the whole family joined him in remonstrance. As the  girl declared that she would not forego the meetings with her lover, the  father swore that she should never leave his roof again, and he tried to  be as good, or bad, as his word. The damsel took her imprisonment as any  girl of spirit would, but was unable to effect her escape until one  evening, as she sat at her window, watching the moon go down and paint  the harbor with a path of light. A tap at the pane, as of a pebble thrown  against it, roused her from her revery. It was her lover on the lawn.
          At her eager signal he ran forward with a light ladder, planted it  against the window-sill, and in less than a minute the twain were running  toward the beach; but the creak of the ladder had been heard, and  grasping their muskets two of the men hurried out. In the track of the  moon the pursuers descried a moving form, and, without waiting to  challenge, they levelled the guns and fired. A woman's cry followed the  report; then a dip of oars was heard that fast grew fainter until it  faded from hearing. On returning to the house they found the girl's room  empty, and next morning her slipper was brought in from the mud at the  landing. Nobody inside of the American lines ever learned what that shot  had done, but if it failed to take a life it robbed Cortelyou of his  mind. He spent the rest of his days in a single room, chained to a staple  in the floor, tramping around and around, muttering and gesturing, and  sometimes startling the passer-by as he showed his white face and ragged  beard at the window.
