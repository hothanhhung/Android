When the Dutch gave the name of Katzbergs to the mountains west of the  Hudson, by reason of the wild-cats and panthers that ranged there, they  obliterated the beautiful Indian Ontiora, &quot;mountains of the sky.&quot; In one  tradition of the red men these hills were bones of a monster that fed on  human beings until the Great Spirit turned it into stone as it was  floundering toward the ocean to bathe. The two lakes near the summit were  its eyes. These peaks were the home of an Indian witch, who adjusted the  weather for the Hudson Valley with the certainty of a signal service  bureau. It was she who let out the day and night in blessed alternation,  holding back the one when the other was at large, for fear of conflict.  Old moons she cut into stars as soon as she had hung new ones in the sky,  and she was often seen perched on Round Top and North Mountain, spinning  clouds and flinging them to the winds. Woe betide the valley residents if  they showed irreverence, for then the clouds were black and heavy, and  through them she poured floods of rain and launched the lightnings,  causing disastrous freshets in the streams and blasting the wigwams of  the mockers. In a frolic humor she would take the form of a bear or deer  and lead the Indian hunters anything but a merry dance, exposing them to  tire and peril, and vanishing or assuming some terrible shape when they  had overtaken her. Sometimes she would lead them to the cloves and would  leap into the air with a mocking &quot;Ho, ho!&quot; just as they stopped with a  shudder at the brink of an abyss. Garden Rock was a spot where she was  often found, and at its foot a lake once spread. This was held in such  awe that an Indian would never wittingly pursue his quarry there; but  once a hunter lost his way and emerged from the forest at the edge of the  pond. Seeing a number of gourds in crotches of the trees he took one, but  fearing the spirit he turned to leave so quickly that he stumbled and it  fell. As it broke, a spring welled from it in such volume that the  unhappy man was gulfed in its waters, swept to the edge of Kaaterskill  clove and dashed on the rocks two hundred and sixty feet below. Nor did  the water ever cease to run, and in these times the stream born of the  witch's revenge is known as Catskill Creek.
