During the  times when it was devoted to this fell purpose there stood in Communipaw  the Wild Goose tavern, where Dutch burghers resorted, to smoke, drink  Hollands, and grow fat, wise, and sleepy in each others' company. The  plague of this inn was Yan Yost Vanderscamp, a nephew of the landlord,  who frequently alarmed the patrons of the house by putting powder into  their pipes and attaching briers beneath their horses' tails, and who  naturally turned pirate when he became older, taking with him to sea his  boon companion, an ill-disposed, ill-favored blackamoor named Pluto, who  had been employed about the tavern. When the landlord died, Vanderscamp  possessed himself of this property, fitted it up with plunder, and at  intervals he had his gang ashore,&mdash;such a crew of singing, swearing,  drinking, gaming devils as Communipaw had never seen the like of; yet the  residents could not summon activity enough to stop the goings-on that  made the Wild Goose a disgrace to their village. The British authorities,  however, caught three of the swashbucklers and strung them up on Gibbet  Island, and things that went on badly in Communipaw after that went on  with quiet and secrecy.
          The pirate and his henchmen were returning to the tavern one night, after  a visit to a rakish-looking vessel in the offing, when a squall broke in  such force as to give their skiff a leeway to the place of executions. As  they rounded that lonely reef a creaking noise overhead caused  Vanderscamp to look up, and he could not repress a shudder as he saw the  bodies of his three messmates, their rags fluttering and their chains  grinding in the wind.
          &quot;Don't you want to see your friends?&quot; sneered Pluto. &quot;You, who are never  afraid of living men, what do you fear from the dead?&quot;
          &quot;Nothing,&quot; answered the pirate. Then, lugging forth his bottle, he took a  long pull at it, and holding it toward the dead felons, he shouted,  &quot;Here's fair weather to you, my lads in the wind, and if you should be  walking the rounds to-night, come in to supper.&quot;
          A clatter of bones and a creak of chains sounded like a laugh. It was  midnight when the boat pulled in at Communipaw, and as the storm  continued Vanderscamp, drenched to the skin, made quick time to the Wild  Goose. As he entered, a sound of revelry overhead smote his ear, and,  being no less astonished than in need of cordials, he hastened up-stairs  and flung open the door. A table stood there, furnished with jugs and  pipes and cans, and by light of candles that burned as blue as brimstone  could be seen the three gallows-birds from Gibbet Island, with halters on  their necks, clinking their tankards together and trolling forth a  drinking-song.
        Starting back with affright as the corpses hailed him with lifted arms  and turned their fishy eyes on him, Vanderscamp slipped at the door and  fell headlong to the bottom of the stairs. Next morning he was found  there by the neighbors, dead to a certainty, and was put away in the  Dutch churchyard at Bergen on the Sunday following. As the house was  rifled and deserted by its occupants, it was hinted that the negro had  betrayed his master to his fellow-buccaneers, and that he, Pluto, was no  other than the devil in disguise. But he was not, for his skiff was seen  floating bottom up in the bay soon after, and his drowned body lodged  among the rocks at the foot of the pirates' gallows.
          For a long time afterwards the island was regarded as a place that  required purging with bell, book, and candle, for shadows were reported  there and faint lights that shot into the air, and to this day, with the  great immigrant station on it and crowds going and coming all the time,  the Battery boatmen prefer not to row around it at night, for they are  likely to see the shades of the soldier and his mistress who were drowned  off the place one windy night, when the girl was aiding the fellow to  escape confinement in the guard-house, to say nothing of Vanderscamp and  his felons.
