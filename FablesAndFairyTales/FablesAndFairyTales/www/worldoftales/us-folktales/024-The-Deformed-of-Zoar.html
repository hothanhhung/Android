          The valley of Zoar, in western New York, is so surrounded by hills that  its discoverers&mdash;a religious people, who gave it a name from Scripture  said, &quot;This is Zoar; it is impregnable. From her we will never go.&quot; And  truly, for lack of roads, they found it so hard to get out, having got  in, that they did not leave it. Among the early settlers here were people  of a family named Wright, whose house became a sort of inn for the  infrequent traveller, inasmuch as they were not troubled with piety, and  had no scruples against the selling of drink and the playing of cards at  late hours. A peddler passed through the valley on his way to Buffalo and  stopped at the Wright house for a lodging, but before he went to bed he  incautiously showed a number of golden trinkets from his pack and drew a  considerable quantity of money out of his pocket when he paid the fee for  his lodging. Hardly had he fallen asleep before his greedy hosts were in  the room, searching for his money. Their lack of caution caused him to  awake, and as he found them rifling his pockets and his pack he sprang up  and showed fight.
          A blow sent him to the bottom of the stairs, where his attempt to escape  was intercepted, and the family closed around him and bound his arms and  legs. They showed him the money they had taken and asked where he had  concealed the rest. He vowed that it was all he had. They insisted that  he had more, and seizing a knife from the table the elder Wright slashed  off one of his toes &quot;to make him confess.&quot; No result came from this, and  six toes were cut off,&mdash;three from each foot; then, in disgust, the  unhappy peddler was knocked on the head and flung through a trap-door  into a shallow cellar. Presently he arose and tried to draw himself out,  but with hatchet and knife they chopped away his fingers and he fell  back. Even the women shared in this work, and leaned forward to gaze into  the cellar to see if he might yet be dead. While listening, they heard  the man invoke the curse of heaven on them: he asked that they should  wear the mark of crime even to the fourth generation, by coming into the  world deformed and mutilated as he was then. And it was so. The next  child born in that house had round, hoof-like feet, with only two toes,  and hands that tapered from the wrist into a single long finger. And in  time there were twenty people so deformed in the valley: The &quot;crab-clawed  Zoarites&quot; they were called.
