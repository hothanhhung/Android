Among those who were not  averse to a cheering cup were three boon companions, Bailey, Hill, and  Evans, farmers of the neighborhood. They loved the tavern better than the  church, and in truth the church folk did not love them well, for they  were suspected of entertaining heresies of the most forbidden character.  It was while they were discussing matters of belief over their glasses  that one of them proposed, in a spirit of bravado, that whichever of the  trio might be first to die should come back from the grave and reveal  himself to the others&mdash;if he could&mdash;thus settling the question as to  whether there was a future.
          Not long after this agreement&mdash;for consent was unanimous&mdash;Hill departed  this life. His friends lamented his absence, especially at the tavern,  but they anticipated no attempt on his part to express the distinguished  consideration that he had felt for his old chums. Some weeks passed, yet  there was no sign, and the two survivors of the party, as they jogged  homeward to the house where both lived, had begun to think and speak less  frequently of the absent one. But one night the household was alarmed by  a terrible cry. Bailey got a light and hurried to the bedside of his  friend, whom he found deathly white and holding his chest as if in pain.  &quot;He has been here!&quot; gasped Evans. &quot;He stood here just now.&quot;
        &quot;Who?&quot; asked Bailey, a creep passing down his spine.
          &quot;Hill! He stood there, where you are now, and touched me with a hand that  was so cold&mdash;cold&mdash;&quot; and Evans shivered violently. On turning back the  collar of his shirt the impression of a hand appeared on the flesh near  the shoulder: a hand in white, with one finger missing. Hill had lost a  finger. There was less of taverns after that night, for Evans carried the  token of that ghostly visit on his person until he, too, had gone to  solve the great secret.
