          When Occuna, a young Seneca, fell in love with a girl whose cabin was  near the present town of Cohoes, he behaved very much as Americans of a  later date have done. He picked wild flowers for her; he played on the  bone pipe and sang sentimental songs in the twilight; he roamed the hills  with her, gathering the loose quartz crystals that the Indians believed  to be the tears of stricken deer, save on Diamond Rock, in Lansingburgh,  where they are the tears of Moneta, a bereaved mother and wife; and in  fine weather they went boating on the Mohawk above the rapids. They liked  to drift idly on the current, because it gave them time to gaze into each  other's eyes, and to build air castles that they would live in in the  future. They were suddenly called to a realization of danger one evening,  for the stream had been subtly drawing them on and on until it had them  in its power. The stroke of the paddle failed and the air castles fell in  dismal ruin. Sitting erect they began their death-song in this wise:
          Occuna: &quot;Daughter of a mighty warrior, the Manitou calls me hence. I hear  the roaring of his voice; I see the lightning of his glance along the  river; he walks in clouds and spray upon the waters.&quot;
          The Maiden: &quot;Thou art thyself a warrior, O Occuna. Hath not thine axe  been often bathed in blood? Hath the deer ever escaped thine arrow or the  beaver avoided thy chase? Thou wilt not fear to go into the presence of  Manitou.&quot;
          Occuna: &quot;Manitou, indeed, respects the strong. When I chose thee from the  women of our tribe I promised that we should live and die together. The  Thunderer calls us now. Welcome, O ghost of Oriska, chief of the  invincible Senecas! A warrior and the daughter of a warrior come to join  you in the feast of the blessed!&quot;
          The boat leaped over the falls, and Occuna, striking on the rocks below,  was killed at once; but, as by a miracle, the girl fell clear of them and  was whirled on the seething current to shoal water, where she made her  escape. For his strength and his virtues the dead man was canonized. His  tribe raised him above the regions of the moon, whence he looked down on  the scenes of his youth with pleasure, and in times of war gave pleasant  dreams and promises to his friends, while he confused the enemy with evil  omens. Whenever his tribe passed the falls they halted and with brief  ceremonials commemorated the death of Occuna.
