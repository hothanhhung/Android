Near quarantine, in an old  house,&mdash;the Austen mansion,&mdash;a soldier of King George hanged himself  because a Yankee maid who lived there would not have him for a husband,  nor any gentleman whose coat was of his color; and, until ghosts went out  of fashion, his spirit, in somewhat heavy boots, with jingling spurs,  often disturbed the nightly quiet of the place.
          The conduct of a damsel in the old town of Richmond was even more stern.  She was the granddaughter, and a pretty one, of a farmer named Britton;  but though Britton by descent and name, she was no friend of Britons,  albeit she might have had half the officers in the neighboring camp at  her feet, if she had wished them there. Once, while mulling a cup of  cider for her grandfather, she was interrupted by a self-invited  myrmidon, who undertook, in a fashion rude and unexpected, to show the  love in which he held her. Before he could kiss her, the girl drew the  hot poker from the mug of drink and jabbed at the vitals of her amorous  foe, burning a hole through his scarlet uniform and printing on his burly  person a lasting memento of the adventure. With a howl of pain the fellow  rushed away, and the privacy of the Britton family was never again  invaded, at least whilst cider was being mulled.
