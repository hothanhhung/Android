Dunderberg, &quot;Thunder Mountain,&quot; at the southern gate of the Hudson  Highlands, is a wooded eminence, chiefly populated by a crew of imps of  stout circumference, whose leader, the Heer, is a bulbous goblin clad in  the dress worn by Dutch colonists two centuries ago, and carrying a  speaking-trumpet, through which he bawls his orders for the blowing of  winds and the touching off of lightnings. These orders are given in Low  Dutch, and are put into execution by the imps aforesaid, who troop into  the air and tumble about in the mist, sometimes smiting the flag or  topsail of a ship to ribbons, or laying the vessel over before the wind  until she is in peril of going on beam ends. At one time a sloop passing  the Dunderberg had nearly foundered, when the crew discovered the  sugar-loaf hat of the Heer at the mast-head. None dared to climb for it,  and it was not until she had driven past Pollopel's Island&mdash;the limit of  the Heer's jurisdiction&mdash;that she righted. As she did so the little hat  spun into the air like a top, creating a vortex that drew up the  storm-clouds, and the sloop kept her way prosperously for the rest of the  voyage. The captain had nailed a horse-shoe to the mast. The &quot;Hat Rogue&quot;  of the Devil's Bridge in Switzerland must be a relative of this gamesome  sprite, for his mischief is usually of a harmless sort; but, to be on the  safe side, the Dutchmen who plied along the river lowered their peaks in  homage to the keeper of the mountain, and for years this was a common  practice. Mariners who paid this courtesy to the Heer of the Donder Berg  were never molested by his imps, though skipper Ouselsticker, of  Fishkill,&mdash;for all he had a parson on board,&mdash;was once beset by a heavy  squall, and the goblin came out of the mist and sat astraddle of his  bowsprit, seeming to guide his schooner straight toward the rocks. The  dominie chanted the song of Saint Nicolaus, and the goblin, unable to  endure either its spiritual potency or the worthy parson's singing, shot  upward like a ball and rode off on the gale, carrying with him the  nightcap of the parson's wife, which he hung on the weathercock of Esopus  steeple, forty miles away.
