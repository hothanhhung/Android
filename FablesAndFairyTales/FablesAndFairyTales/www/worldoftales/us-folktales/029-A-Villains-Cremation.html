Bramley's Mountain, near the present village of Bloomfield, New York, on  the edge of the Catskill group, was the home of a young couple that had  married with rejoicing and had taken up the duties and pleasures of  housekeeping with enthusiasm. To be sure, in those days housekeeping was  not a thing to be much afraid of, and the servant question had not come  up for discussion. The housewives did the work themselves, and the  husband had no valets. The domicile of this particular pair was merely a  tent of skins stretched around a frame of poles, and their furniture  consisted principally of furs strewn over the earth floor; but they loved  each other truly. The girl was thankful to be taken from her home to  live, because, up to the time of her marriage, she had been persecuted by  a morose and ill-looking fellow of her tribe, who laid siege to her  affection with such vehemence that the more he pleaded the greater was  her dislike; and now she hoped that she had seen the last of him. But  that was not to be. He lurked about the wigwam of the pair, torturing  himself with the sight of their felicity, and awaiting his chance to  prove his hate. This chance came when the husband had gone to Lake  Delaware to fish, for he rowed after and gave battle in the middle of the  pond. Taken by surprise, and being insufficiently armed, the husband was  killed and his body flung into the water. Then, casting an affectionate  leer at the wife who had watched this act of treachery and malice with  speechless horror from the mountain-side, he drove his canoe ashore and  set off in pursuit of her. She retreated so slowly as to allow him to  keep her in sight, and when she entered a cave he pressed forward  eagerly, believing that now her escape was impossible; but she had  purposely trapped him there, for she had already explored a tortuous  passage that led to the upper air, and by this she had left the cavern in  safety while he was groping and calling in the dark. Returning to the  entrance, she loosened, by a jar, a ledge that overhung it, so that the  door was almost blocked; then, gathering light wood from the dry trees  around her, she made a fire and hurled the burning sticks into the prison  where the wretch was howling, until he was dead in smoke and flame. When  his yells and curses had been silenced she told a friend what she had  done, then going back to the lake, she sang her death-song and cast  herself into the water, hoping thus to rejoin her husband.
