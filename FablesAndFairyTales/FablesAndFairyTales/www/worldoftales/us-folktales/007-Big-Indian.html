          Intermarriages between white people and red ones in this country were not  uncommon in the days when our ancestors led as rude a life as the  natives, and several places in the Catskills commemorate this fact. Mount  Utsayantha, for example, is named for an Indian woman whose life, with  that of her baby and her white husband, was lost there. For the white men  early found friends among these mountains. As far back as 1663 they  spared Catherine Dubois and her three children, after some rash spirits  had abducted them and carried them to a place on the upper Walkill, to do  them to death; for the captives raised a Huguenot hymn and the hearts of  their captors were softened.
          In Esopus Valley lived Winnisook, whose height was seven feet, and who  was known among the white settlers as &quot;the big Indian.&quot; He loved a white  girl of the neighborhood, one Gertrude Molyneux, and had asked for her  hand; but while she was willing, the objections of her family were too  strong to be overcome, and she was teased into marriage with Joseph  Bundy, of her own race, instead. She liked the Indian all the better  after that, however, because Bundy proved to be a bad fellow, and  believing that she could be happier among barbarians than among a people  that approved such marriages, she eloped with Winnisook. For a long time  all trace of the runaway couple was lost, but one day the man having gone  down to the plain to steal cattle, it was alleged, was discovered by some  farmers who knew him, and who gave hot chase, coming up with him at the  place now called Big Indian.
          Foremost in the chase was Bundy. As he came near to the enemy of his  peace he exclaimed, &quot;I think the best way to civilize that yellow serpent  is to let daylight into his heart,&quot; and, drawing his rifle to his  shoulder, he fired. Mortally wounded, yet instinctively seeking refuge,  the giant staggered into the hollow of a pine-tree, where the farmers  lost sight of him. There, however, he was found by Gertrude, bolt  upright, yet dead. The unwedded widow brought her dusky children to the  place and spent the remainder of her days near his grave. Until a few  years ago the tree was still pointed out, but a railroad company has now  covered it with an embankment.
