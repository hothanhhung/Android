Parley  resulted in nothing, so the bad one tried force, but he was routed in  open fight and found it desirable to get away from the scene of action as  soon as possible. He retreated across the Sound near the head of East  River. The tide was out, so he stepped from island to island, without  trouble, and those reefs and islands are to this day the Devil's  Stepping-Stones. On reaching Throgg's Neck he sat down in a despairing  attitude and brooded on his defeat, until, roused to a frenzy at the  thought of it, he resolved to renew the war on terms advantageous  entirely to himself. In that day Connecticut was free from rocks, but  Long Island was covered with them; so he gathered all he could lay his  hands on and tossed them at the Indians that he could see across the  Sound near Cold Spring until the supply had given out. The red men who  last inhabited Connecticut used to show white men where the missiles  landed and where the devil struck his heel into the ground as he sprang  from the shore in his haste to reach Long Island. At Cold Spring other  footprints and one of his toes are shown. Establishing himself at Coram,  he troubled the people of the country for many years, so that between the  devil on the west and the Montauks on the east they were plagued indeed;  for though their guard at Watch Hill, Rhode Island, and other places  often apprised them of the coming of the Montauks, they never knew which  way to look for the devil.
