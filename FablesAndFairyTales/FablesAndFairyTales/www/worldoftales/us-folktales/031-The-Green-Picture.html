          In a cellar in Green Street, Schenectady, there appeared, some years ago,  the silhouette of a human form, painted on the floor in mould. It was  swept and scrubbed away, but presently it was there again, and month by  month, after each removal, it returned: a mass of fluffy mould, always in  the shape of a recumbent man. When it was found that the house stood on  the site of the old Dutch burial ground, the gossips fitted this and that  together and concluded that the mould was planted by a spirit whose  mortal part was put to rest a century and more ago, on the spot covered  by the house, and that the spirit took this way of apprising people that  they were trespassing on its grave. Others held that foul play had been  done, and that a corpse, hastily and shallowly buried, was yielding  itself back to the damp cellar in vegetable form, before its resolution  into simpler elements. But a darker meaning was that it was the outline  of a vampire that vainly strove to leave its grave, and could not because  a virtuous spell had been worked about the place.
          A vampire is a dead man who walks about seeking for those whose blood he  can suck, for only by supplying new life to its cold limbs can he keep  the privilege of moving about the earth. He fights his way from his  coffin, and those who meet his gray and stiffened shape, with fishy eyes  and blackened mouth, lurking by open windows, biding his time to steal in  and drink up a human life, fly from him in terror and disgust. In  northern Rhode Island those who die of consumption are believed to be  victims of vampires who work by charm, draining the blood by slow  draughts as they lie in their graves. To lay this monster he must be  taken up and burned; at least, his heart must be; and he must be  disinterred in the daytime when he is asleep and unaware. If he died with  blood in his heart he has this power of nightly resurrection. As late as  1892 the ceremony of heart-burning was performed at Exeter, Rhode Island,  to save the family of a dead woman that was threatened with the same  disease that removed her, namely, consumption. But the Schenectady  vampire has yielded up all his substance, and the green picture is no  more.
