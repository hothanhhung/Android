          A skull is built into the wall above the door of the court-house at  Goshen, New York. It was taken from a coffin unearthed in 1842, when the  foundation of the building was laid. People said there was no doubt about  it, only Claudius Smith could have worn that skull, and he deserved to be  publicly pilloried in that manner. Before the Revolutionary war Smith was  a farmer in Monroe, New York, and being prosperous enough to feel the  king's taxes no burden, to say nothing of his jealousy of the advantage  that an independent government would be to the hopes of his poorer  neighbors, he declared for the king. After the declaration of  independence had been published, his sympathies were illustrated in an  unpleasantly practical manner by gathering a troop of other Tories about  him, and, emboldened by the absence of most of the men of his vicinage in  the colonial army, he began to harass the country as grievously in foray  as the red-coats were doing in open field.
          He pillaged houses and barns, then burned them; he insulted women, he  drove away cattle and horses, he killed several persons who had  undertaken to defend their property. His &quot;campaigns&quot; were managed with  such secrecy that nobody knew when or whence to look for him. His murder  of Major Nathaniel Strong, of Blooming Grove, roused indignation to such  a point that a united effort was made to catch him, a money reward for  success acting as a stimulus to the vigilance of the hunters, and at last  he was captured on Long Island. He was sent back to Goshen, tried,  convicted, and on January 22, 1779, was hanged, with five of his band.  The bodies of the culprits were buried in the jail-yard, on the spot  where the court-house stands, and old residents identified Smith's  skeleton, when it was accidentally exhumed, by its uncommon size. A  farmer from an adjacent town made off with a thigh bone, and a mason  clapped mortar into the empty skull and cemented it into the wall, where  it long remained.
