          In Copake, New York, among the Berkshire Hills, less than a century ago,  lived Francis Woolcott, a dark, tall man, with protruding teeth, whose  sinister laugh used to give his neighbors a creep along their spines. He  had no obvious trade or calling, but the farmers feared him so that he  had no trouble in making levies: pork, flour, meal, cider, he could have  what he chose for the asking, for had he not halted horses at the plow so  that neither blows nor commands could move them for two hours? Had he not  set farmer Raught's pigs to walking on their hind legs and trying to  talk? When he shouted &quot;Hup! hup! hup!&quot; to farmer Williams's children, had  they not leaped to the moulding of the parlor wainscot,&mdash;a yard above the  floor and only an inch wide,&mdash;and walked around it, afterward skipping  like birds from chair-back to chair-back, while the furniture stood as if  nailed to the floor? And was he not the chief of thirteen night-riders,  whose faces no man had seen, nor wanted to see, and whom he sent about  the country on errands of mischief every night when the moon was growing  old? As to moons, had he not found a mystic message from our satellite on  Mount Riga, graven on a meteor?
          Horses' tails were tied, hogs foamed at the mouth and walked like men,  cows gave blood for milk. These night-riders met Woolcott in a grove of  ash and chestnut trees, each furnished with a stolen bundle of oat straw,  and these bundles Woolcott changed to black horses when the night had  grown dark enough not to let the way of the change be seen. These horses  could not cross streams of water, and on the stroke of midnight they fell  to pieces and were oaten sheaves once more, but during their time of  action they rushed through woods, bearing their riders safely, and tore  like hurricanes across the fields, leaping bushes, fences, even trees,  without effort. Never could traces be found of them the next day. At last  the devil came to claim his own. Woolcott, who was ninety years old, lay  sick and helpless in his cabin. Clergymen refused to see him, but two or  three of his neighbors stifled their fears and went to the wizard's house  to soothe his dying moments. With the night came storm, and with its  outbreak the old man's face took on such a strange and horrible look that  the watchers fell back in alarm. There was a burst of purple flame at the  window, a frightful peal, a smell of sulphur, and Woolcott was dead. When  the watchers went out the roads were dry, and none in the village had  heard wind, rain, or thunder. It was the coming of the fiend.
