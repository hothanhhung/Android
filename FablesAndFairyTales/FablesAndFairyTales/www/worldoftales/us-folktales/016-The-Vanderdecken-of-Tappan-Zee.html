          It is Saturday night; the swell of the Hudson lazily heaves against the  shores of Tappan Zee, the cliff above Tarrytown where the white lady  cries on winter nights is pale in starlight, and crickets chirp in the  boskage. It is so still that the lap of oars can be heard coming across  the water at least a mile away. Some small boat, evidently, but of heavy  build, for it takes a vigorous hand to propel it, and now there is a  grinding of oars on thole-pins. Strange that it is not yet seen, for the  sound is near. Look! Is that a shadow crossing that wrinkle of starlight  in the water? The oars have stopped, and there is no wind to make that  sound of a sigh.
          Ho, Rambout Van Dam! Is it you? Are you still expiating your oath to pull  from Kakiat to Spuyten Duyvil before the dawn of Sabbath, if it takes you  a month of Sundays? Better for you had you passed the night with your  roistering friends at Kakiat, or started homeward earlier, for  Sabbath-breaking is no sin now, and you, poor ghost, will find little  sympathy for your plight. Grant that your month of Sundays, or your cycle  of months of Sundays, be soon up, for it is sad to be reminded that we  may be punished for offences many years forgotten. When the sun is high  to-morrow a score of barges will vex the sea of Tappan, each crowded with  men and maids from New Amsterdam, jigging to profane music and refreshing  themselves with such liquors as you, Rambout, never even smelled&mdash;be  thankful for that much. If your shade sits blinking at them from the  wooded buttresses of the Palisades, you must repine, indeed, at the  hardness of your fate.
