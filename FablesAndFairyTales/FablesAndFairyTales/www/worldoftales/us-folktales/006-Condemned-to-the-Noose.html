          Ralph Sutherland, who, early in the last century, occupied a stone house  a mile from Leeds, in the Catskills, was a man of morose and violent  disposition, whose servant, a Scotch girl, was virtually a slave,  inasmuch as she was bound to work for him without pay until she had  refunded to him her passage-money to this country. Becoming weary of  bondage and of the tempers of her master, the girl ran away. The man set  off in a raging chase, and she had not gone far before Sutherland  overtook her, tied her by the wrists to his horse's tail, and began the  homeward journey. Afterward, he swore that the girl stumbled against the  horse's legs, so frightening the animal that it rushed off madly,  pitching him out of the saddle and dashing the servant to death on rocks  and trees; yet, knowing how ugly-tempered he could be, his neighbors were  better inclined to believe that he had driven the horse into a gallop,  intending to drag the girl for a short distance, as a punishment, and to  rein up before he had done serious mischief. On this supposition he was  arrested, tried, and sentenced to die on the scaffold.
          The tricks of circumstantial evidence, together with pleas advanced by  influential relatives of the prisoner, induced the court to delay  sentence until the culprit should be ninety-nine years old, but it was  ordered that, while released on his own recognizance, in the interim, he  should keep a hangman's noose about his neck and show himself before the  judges in Catskill once every year, to prove that he wore his badge of  infamy and kept his crime in mind. This sentence he obeyed, and there  were people living recently who claimed to remember him as he went about  with a silken cord knotted at his throat. He was always alone, he seldom  spoke, his rough, imperious manner had departed. Only when children asked  him what the rope was for were his lips seen to quiver, and then he would  hurry away. After dark his house was avoided, for gossips said that a  shrieking woman passed it nightly, tied at the tail of a giant horse with  fiery eyes and smoking nostrils; that a skeleton in a winding sheet had  been found there; that a curious thing, somewhat like a woman, had been  known to sit on his garden wall, with lights shining from her  finger-tips, uttering unearthly laughter; and that domestic animals  reproached the man by groaning and howling beneath his windows.
          These beliefs he knew, yet he neither grieved, nor scorned, nor answered  when he was told of them. Years sped on. Every year deepened his reserve  and loneliness, and some began to whisper that he would take his own way  out of the world, though others answered that men who were born to be  hanged would never be drowned; but a new republic was created; new laws  were made; new judges sat to minister them; so, on Ralph Sutherland's  ninety-ninth birthday anniversary, there were none who would accuse him  or execute sentence. He lived yet another year, dying in 1801. But was it  from habit, or was it in self-punishment and remorse, that he never took  off the cord? for, when he drew his last breath, though it was in his own  house, his throat was still encircled by the hangman's rope.
