          They have some pretty big mosquitoes in New Jersey and on Long Island,  but, if report of their ancestry is true, they have degenerated in size  and voracity; for the grandfather of all mosquitoes used to live in the  neighborhood of Fort Onondaga, New York, and sallying out whenever he was  hungry, would eat an Indian or two and pick his teeth with their ribs.  The red men had no arms that could prevail against it, but at last the  Holder of the Heavens, hearing their cry for aid, came down and attacked  the insect. Finding that it had met its match, the mosquito flew away so  rapidly that its assailant could hardly keep it in sight. It flew around  the great lake, then turned eastward again. It sought help vainly of the  witches that brooded in the sink-holes, or Green Lakes (near Janesville,  New York), and had reached the salt lake of Onondaga when its pursuer  came up and killed it, the creature piling the sand into hills in its  dying struggles.
          As its blood poured upon the earth it became small mosquitoes, that  gathered about the Holder of the Heavens and stung him so sorely that he  half repented the service that he had done to men. The Tuscaroras say  that this was one of two monsters that stood on opposite banks of the  Seneca River and slew all men that passed. Hiawatha killed the other one.  On their reservation is a stone, marked by the form of the Sky Holder,  that shows where he rested during the chase, while his tracks were until  lately seen south of Syracuse, alternating with footprints of the  mosquito, which were shaped like those of a bird, and twenty inches long.  At Brighton, New York, where these marks appeared, they were  reverentially renewed by the Indians for many years.
