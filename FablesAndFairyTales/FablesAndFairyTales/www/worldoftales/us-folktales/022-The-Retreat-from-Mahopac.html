          After the English had secured the city of New Amsterdam and had begun to  extend their settlements along the Hudson, the Indians congregated in  large numbers about Lake Mahopac, and rejected all overtures for the  purchase of that region. In their resolution they were sustained by their  young chief Omoyao, who refused to abandon on on any terms the country  where his fathers had solong hunted, fished, and built their lodges. A  half-breed, one Joliper, a member of this tribe, was secretly in the pay  of the English, but the allurements and insinuations that he put forth on  their behalf were as futile as the breathing of wind in the leaves. At  last the white men grew angry. Have the land they would, by evil course  if good ways were refused, and commissioning Joliper to act for them in a  decisive manner, they guaranteed to supply him with forces if his  negotiations fell through. This man never thought it needful to  negotiate. He knew the temper of his tribe and he was too jealous of his  chief to go to him for favors, because he loved Maya, the chosen one of  Omoyao.
          At the door of Maya's tent he entreated her to go with him to the white  settlements, and on her refusal he broke into angry threats, declaring,  in the self-forgetfulness of passion, that he would kill her lover and  lead the English against the tribe. Unknown to both Omoyao had overheard  this interview, and he immediately sent runners to tell all warriors of  his people to meet him at once on the island in the lake. Though the  runners were cautioned to keep their errand secret, it is probable that  Joliper suspected that the alarm had gone forth, and he resolved to  strike at once; so he summoned his renegades, stole into camp next  evening and made toward Maya's wigwam, intending to take her to a place  of safety. Seeing the chief at the door, he shot an arrow at him, but the  shaft went wide and slew the girl's father. Realizing, upon this assault,  that he was outwitted and that his people were outnumbered, the chief  called to Maya to meet him at the island, and plunged into the brush,  after seeing that she had taken flight in an opposite direction. The  vengeful Joliper was close behind him with his renegades, and the chief  was captured; then, that he might not communicate with his people or  delay the operations against them, it was resolved to put him to death.
          He was tied to a tree, the surrounding wood was set on fire, and he was  abandoned to his fate, his enemies leaving him to destruction in their  haste to reach the place of the council and slay or capture all who were  there. Hardly were they out of hearing ere the plash of a paddle sounded  through the roar of flame and Maya sprang upon the bank, cut her lover's  bonds, and with him made toward the island, which they reached by a  protected way before the assailants had arrived. They told the story of  Joliper's cruelty and treason, and when his boats were seen coming in to  shore they had eyes and hands only for Joliper. He was the first to land.  Hardly had he touched the strand before he was surrounded by a frenzied  crowd and had fallen bleeding from a hundred gashes.
          The Indians were overpowered after a brief and bloody resistance. They  took safety in flight. Omoyao and Maya, climbing upon the rock above  their &quot;council chamber,&quot; found that while most of their people had  escaped their own retreat was cut off, and that it would be impossible to  reach any of the canoes. They preferred death to torture and captivity,  so, hand in hand, they leaped together down the cliff, and the English  claimed the land next day.
