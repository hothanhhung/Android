          On the rock platform where the Catskill Mountain House now stands,  commanding one of the fairest views in the world, old chief Shandaken set  his wigwam,&mdash;for it is a mistake to suppose that barbarians are  indifferent to beauty,&mdash;and there his daughter, Lotowana, was sought in  marriage by his braves. She, however, kept faith to an early vow  exchanged with a young chief of the Mohawks. A suitor who was  particularly troublesome was Norsereddin, proud, morose, dark-featured, a  stranger to the red man, a descendant, so he claimed, from Egyptian  kings, and who lived by himself on Kaaterskill Creek, appearing among  white settlements but rarely.
          On one of his visits to Catskill, a tavern-lounging Dutchman wagered him  a thousand golden crowns that he could not win Lotowana, and, stung by  avarice as well as inflamed by passion, Norsereddin laid new siege to her  heart. Still the girl refused to listen, and Shandaken counselled him to  be content with the smiles of others, thereby so angering the Egyptian  that he assailed the chief and was driven from the camp with blows; but  on the day of Lotowana's wedding with the Mohawk he returned, and in a  honeyed speech asked leave to give a jewel to the bride to show that he  had stifled jealousy and ill will. The girl took the handsome box he gave  her and drew the cover, when a spring flew forward, driving into her hand  the poisoned tooth of a snake that had been affixed to it. The venom was  strong, and in a few minutes Lotowana lay dead at her husband's feet.
          Though the Egyptian had disappeared into the forest directly on the  acceptance of his treacherous gift, twenty braves set off in pursuit, and  overtaking him on the Kalkberg, they dragged him back to the rock where  father and husband were bewailing the maid's untimely fate. A pile of  fagots was heaped within a few feet of the precipice edge, and tying  their captive on them, they applied the torch, dancing about with cries  of exultation as the shrieks of the wretch echoed from the cliffs. The  dead girl was buried by the mourning tribe, while the ashes of  Norsereddin were left to be blown abroad. On the day of his revenge  Shandaken left his ancient dwelling-place, and his camp-fires never  glimmered afterward on the front of Ontiora.
