          The shores of Lakes George and Champlain were ravaged by war. Up and down  those lovely waters swept the barges of French and English, and the green  hills rang to the shrill of bugles, the boom of cannon, and the yell of  savages. Fiction and history have been weft across the woods and the  memory of deeds still echoes among the heights. It was at Glen's Falls,  in the cave on the rock in the middle of the river, that the brave Uncas  held the watch with Hawkeye. Bloody Defile and Bloody Pond, between there  and Lake George, take their names from the &quot;Bloody morning scout&quot; sent  out by Sir William Johnson on a September day in 1755 to check Dieskau  until Fort William Henry could be completed. In the action that ensued,  Colonel Williams, founder of Williams College, and Captain Grant, of the  Connecticut line, great-grandfather of the President who bore that name,  were killed. The victims, dead and wounded alike, having been flung into  Bloody Pond, it was thick and red for days, and tradition said that in  after years it resumed its hue of crimson at sunset and held it until  dawn. The captured, who were delivered to the Indians, had little to  hope, for their white allies could not stay their savagery. Blind Rock  was so called because the Indians brought a white man there, and tearing  his eyes out, flung them into embers at the foot of the stone. Captives  were habitually tortured, blazing splinters of pine being thrust into  their flesh, their nails torn out, and their bodies slashed with knives  before they went to the stake. An English prisoner was allowed to run the  gauntlet here. They had already begun to strike at him as he sped between  the lines, when he seized a pappoose, flung it on a fire, and, in the  instant of confusion that followed, snatched an axe, cut the bonds of a  comrade who had been doomed to die, and both escaped.
          But the best-known history of this region is that of Rogers's Rock, or  Rogers's Slide, a lofty precipice at the lower end of Lake George. Major  Rogers did not toboggan down this rock in leather trousers, but his  escape was no less remarkable than if he had. On March 13, 1758, while  reconnoitring near Ticonderoga with two hundred rangers, he was surprised  by a force of French and Indians. But seventeen of his men escaped death  or capture, and he was pursued nearly to the brink of this cliff. During  a brief delay among the red men, arising from the loss of his trail, he  had time to throw his pack down the slide, reverse his snow-shoes, and go  back over his own track to the head of a ravine before they emerged from  the woods, and, seeing that his shoe-marks led to the rock, while none  pointed back, they concluded that he had flung himself off and committed  suicide to avoid capture. Great was their disappointment when they saw  the major on the frozen surface of the lake beneath going at a lively  rate toward Fort William Henry. He had gained the ice by way of the cleft  in the rocks, but the savages, believing that he had leaped over the  precipice, attributed his preservation to the Great Spirit and forbore to  fire on him. Unconsciously, he had chosen the best possible place to  disappear from, for the Indians held it in superstitious regard,  believing that spirits haunted the wood and hurled bad souls down the  cliff, drowning them in the lake, instead of allowing them to go to the  happy hunting grounds. The major reached his quarters in safety, and  lived to take up arms against the land of his birth when the colonies  revolted, seventeen years later.
