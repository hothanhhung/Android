A man and his wife dwelt there who seemed to be fondly  attached to each other, and whose love should have been the stronger  because of their three children none grew to years. A mutual sorrow is as  close a tie as a common affection. One day, while on a visit to a friend,  the wife saw her husband drive by in a carriage with a showy woman beside  him. She went home at once, and when the supposed recreant returned she  met him with bitter reproaches. He answered never a word, but took his  hat and left the house, never to be seen again in the places that had  known him.
          The wife watched and waited, daily looking for his return, but days  lengthened into weeks, months, years, and still he came not. Sometimes  she lamented that she had spoken hastily and harshly, thinking that, had  she known all, she might have found him blameless. There was no family to  look after, no wholesome occupation that she sought, so the days went by  in listening and watching, until, at last, her body and mind gave way,  and the familiar sight of her face, watching from a second floor window,  was seen no longer. Her last day came. She had risen from her bed; life  and mind seemed for a moment to be restored to her; and standing where  she had stood so often, her form supported by a half-closed shutter and a  grasp on the sash, she looked into the street once more, sighed  hopelessly, and so died. It was her shade that long watched at the  windows; it was her waxen face, heavy with fatigue and pain, that was  dimly seen looking over the balusters in the evening.
