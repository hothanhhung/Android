          It was during the years when the Saranacs were divided that Howling Wind,  one of the young men of Indian Carry, saw and fell in love with a girl of  the family on Tupper Lake. He quickly found a way to tell his liking, and  the couple met often in the woods and on the shore. He made bold to row  her around the quieter bays, and one moonlight evening he took her to  Devil's Rock, or Devil's Pulpit, where he told her the story of the  place. This was to the effect that the fiend had paddled, on timbers, by  means of his tail, to that rock, and had assembled fish and game about  him in large numbers by telling them that he was going to preach to them,  instead of which moral procedure he pounced upon and ate all that were  within his grasp.
          As so often happened in Indian history, the return of these lovers was  seen by a disappointed rival, who had hurried back to camp and secured  the aid of half a dozen men to arrest the favored one as soon as he  should land. The capture was made after a struggle, and Howling Wind was  dragged to the chief's tent for sentence. That sentence was death, and  with a refinement of cruelty that was rare even among the Indians, the  girl was ordered to execute it. She begged and wept to no avail. An axe  was put into her hands, and she was ordered to despatch the prisoner. She  took the weapon; her face grew stern and the tears dried on her cheeks;  her lover, bound to a tree, gazed at her in amazement; his rival watched,  almost in glee. Slowly the girl crossed the open space to her lover. She  raised the tomahawk and at a blow severed the thongs that held him, then,  like a flash, she leaped upon his rival, who had sprung forward to  interfere, and clove his skull with a single stroke. The lovers fled as  only those can fly who run for life. Happily for them, they met a party  from the Carry coming to rescue Howling Wind from the danger to which his  courtship had exposed him, and it was even said that this party entered  the village and by presenting knives and arrows at the breast of the  chief obtained his now superfluous consent to the union of the fugitives.  The pair reached the Carry in safety and lived a long and happy life  together.
