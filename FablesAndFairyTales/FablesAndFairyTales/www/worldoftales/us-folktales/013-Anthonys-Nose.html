          The Hudson Highlands are suggestively named Bear Mountain, Sugar Loaf,  Cro' Nest, Storm King, called by the Dutch Boterberg, or Butter Hill,  from its likeness to a pat of butter; Beacon Hill, where the fires blazed  to tell the country that the Revolutionary war was over; Dunderberg,  Mount Taurus, so called because a wild bull that had terrorized the  Highlands was chased out of his haunts on this height, and was killed by  falling from a cliff on an eminence to the northward, known, in  consequence, as Breakneck Hill. These, with Anthony's Nose, are the  principal points of interest in the lovely and impressive panorama that  unfolds before the view as the boats fly onward.
          Concerning the last-named elevation, the aquiline promontory that abuts  on the Hudson opposite Dunderberg, it takes title from no resemblance to  the human feature, but is so named because Anthony Van Corlaer, the  trumpeter, who afterwards left a reason for calling the upper boundary of  Manhattan Island Spuyten Duyvil Creek, killed the first sturgeon ever  eaten at the foot of this mountain. It happened in this wise: By  assiduous devotion to keg and flagon Anthony had begotten a nose that was  the wonder and admiration of all who knew it, for its size was  prodigious; in color it rivalled the carbuncle, and it shone like  polished copper. As Anthony was lounging over the quarter of Peter  Stuyvesant's galley one summer morning this nose caught a ray from the  sun and reflected it hissing into the water, where it killed a sturgeon  that was rising beside the vessel. The fish was pulled aboard, eaten, and  declared good, though the singed place savored of brimstone, and in  commemoration of the event Stuyvesant dubbed the mountain that rose above  his vessel Anthony's Nose.
