          A curious tale of the Rosicrucians runs to the effect that more than two  centuries ago a band of German colonists entered the Ramapo valley and  put up houses of stone, like those they had left in the Hartz Mountains,  and when the Indians saw how they made knives and other wonderful things  out of metal, which they extracted from the rocks by fire, they believed  them to be manitous and went away, not wishing to resist their possession  of the land. There was treasure here, for High Tor, or Torn Mountain, had  been the home of Amasis, youngest of the magi who had followed the star  of Bethlehem. He had found his way, through Asia and Alaska, to this  country, had taken to wife a native woman, by whom he had a child, and  here on the summit he had built a temple. Having refused the sun worship,  when the Indians demanded that he should take their faith, he was set  upon, and would have been killed had not an earthquake torn the ground at  his feet, opening a new channel for the Hudson and precipitating into it  every one but the magus and his daughter. To him had been revealed in  magic vision the secrets of wealth in the rocks.
          The leader in the German colony, one Hugo, was a man of noble origin, who  had a wife and two children: a boy, named after himself; a girl,&mdash;Mary.  Though it had been the custom in the other country to let out the forge  fires once in seven years, Hugo opposed that practice in the forge he had  built as needless. But his men murmured and talked of the salamander that  once in seven years attains its growth in unquenched flame and goes forth  doing mischief. On the day when that period was ended the master entered  his works and saw the men gazing into the furnace at a pale form that  seemed made from flame, that was nodding and turning in the fire,  occasionally darting its tongue at them or allowing its tail to fall out  and lie along the stone floor. As he came to the door he, too, was  transfixed, and the fire seemed burning his vitals, until he felt water  sprinkled on his face, and saw that his wife, whom he had left at home  too ill to move, stood behind him and was casting holy water into the  furnace, speaking an incantation as she did so. At that moment a storm  arose, and a rain fell that put out the fire; but as the last glow faded  the lady fell dead.
          When her children were to be consecrated, seven years later, those who  stood outside of the church during the ceremony saw a vivid flash, and  the nurse turned from the boy in her fright. She took her hands from her  eyes. The child was gone. Twice seven years had passed and the daughter  remained unspotted by the world, for, on the night when her father had  led her to the top of High Torn Mountain and shown her what Amasis had  seen,&mdash;the earth spirits in their caves heaping jewels and offering to  give them if Hugo would speak the word that binds the free to the earth  forces and bars his future for a thousand years,&mdash;it was her prayer that  brought him to his senses and made the scene below grow dim, though the  baleful light of the salamander clinging to the rocks at the bottom of  the cave sent a glow into the sky.
          Many nights after that the glow was seen on the height and Hugo was  missing from his home, but for lack of a pure soul to stand as  interpreter he failed to read the words that burned in the triangle on  the salamander's back, and returned in rage and jealousy. A knightly man  had of late appeared in the settlement, and between him and Mary a tender  feeling had arisen, that, however, was unexpressed until, after saving  her from the attack of a panther, he had allowed her to fall into his  arms. She would willingly then have declared her love for him, but he  placed her gently and regretfully from him and said, &quot;When you slept I  came to you and put a crown of gems on your head: that was because I was  in the power of the earth spirit. Then I had power only over the element  of fire, that either consumes or hardens to stone; but now water and life  are mine. Behold! Wear these, for thou art worthy.&quot; And touching the  tears that had fallen from her eyes, they turned into lilies in his  hands, and he put them on her brow.
          &quot;Shall we meet again?&quot; asked the girl.
          &quot;I do not know,&quot; said he. &quot;I tread the darkness of the universe alone,  and I peril my redemption by yielding to this love of earth. Thou art  redeemed already, but I must make my way back to God through obedience  tested in trial. Know that I am one of those that left heaven for love of  man. We were of that subtle element which is flame, burning and glowing  with love,&mdash;and when thy mother came to me with the power of purity to  cast me out of the furnace, I lost my shape of fire and took that of a  human being,&mdash;a child. I have been with thee often, and was rushing to  annihilation, because I could not withstand the ordeal of the senses. Had  I yielded, or found thee other than thou art, I should have become again  an earth spirit. I have been led away by wish for power, such as I have  in my grasp, and forgot the mission to the suffering. I became a wanderer  over the earth until I reached this land, the land that you call new.  Here was to be my last trial and here I am to pass the gate of fire.&quot;
          As he spoke voices arose from the settlement.
          &quot;They are coming,&quot; said he. The stout form of Hugo was in advance. With a  fierce oath he sprang on the young man. &quot;He has ruined my household,&quot; he  cried. &quot;Fling him into the furnace!&quot; The young man stood waiting, but his  brow was serene. He was seized, and in a few moments had disappeared  through the mouth of the burning pit. But Mary, looking up, saw a shape  in robes of silvery light, and it drifted upward until it vanished in the  darkness. The look of horror on her face died away, and a peace came to  it that endured until the end.
