          It is a well-known tradition near Magdeburg, that  when a man who is a thief by inheritance,&mdash;that is  to say, whose father and grandfather and great-grandfather  before him, three generations of his  family, have been thieves; or whose mother has  committed a theft, or been possessed with an  intense longing to steal something at the time  immediately preceding his birth; it is the tradition  that if such a man should be hanged, at the  foot of the gallows whereon his last breath was  exhaled will spring up a plant of hideous form  known as the Alraun or Gallows Mannikin. It is  an unsightly object to look at, and has broad, dark  green leaves, with a single yellow flower. The  plant, however, has great power, and whosoever is  its possessor never more knows what it is to want  money.
          It is a feat full of the greatest danger to obtain  it. If not taken up from the root, clean out of the  soil, it is altogether valueless, and he who makes the  experiment wantonly risks his life. The moment  the earth is struck with the spade, the bitterest  cries and shrieks burst forth from it, and while the  roots are being laid bare demons are heard to howl  in horrid concert. When the preparatory work is  done, and when the hand of the daring man is laid  on the stem to pluck forth his prize, then is it as if  all the fiends of hell were let loose upon him, such  shrieking, such howling, such clanging of chains,  such crashing of thunder, and such flashing of forked  lightning assail him on every side. If his heart  fail him but for one moment his life is forfeit.  Many a bold heart engaged in this trial has ceased  to beat under the fatal tree; many a brave man's  body has been found mangled and torn to pieces on  that accursed spot.
          There is, however, happily, only one day in the  month, the first Friday, on which this plant appears,  and on the night of that day only may it be plucked  from its hiding-place. The way it is done is this.  Whoso seeks to win it fasts all day. At sundown  he sets forth on his fearful adventure, taking with  him a coal-black hound, which has not a single fleck  of white on its whole body, and which he has compelled  likewise to fast for four-and-twenty hours  previously. At midnight he takes his stand under  the gallows, and there stuffs his ears with wool or  wax, so that he may hear nothing. As the dread  hour arrives, he stoops down and makes three  crosses over the Alraun, and then commences to  dig for the roots in a perfect circle around it.  When he has laid it entirely bare, so that it only  holds to the ground by the points of its roots, he  calls the hound to him, and ties the plant to its tail.  He then shows the dog some meat, which he flings  to a short distance from the spot. Ravenous with  hunger, the hound springs after it, dragging the  plant up by the root, but before he can reach the  tempting morsel he is struck dead as by some  invisible hand.
          The adventurer, who all the while stood by the  plant to aid in its uprooting should the strength of  the animal prove insufficient, then rushes forward,  and, detaching it from the body of the dead hound,  grasps it firmly in both hands. He then wraps it  up carefully in a silken cloth, first, however, washing  it well in red wine, and then bears it homeward.  The hound is buried in the spot whence the Alraun  has been extracted.
          On reaching home the man deposits his treasure  in a strong chest, with three locks, and only visits  it every first Friday in the month, or, rather, after  the new moon. On these occasions he again washes  it with red wine, and enfolds it afresh in a clean  silken cloth of white and red colours.
          If he has any question to ask, or any request to  make, he then puts the one or proffers the other.  If he wish to know of things in the future, the  Alraun will tell him truly, but he will only get one  answer in the moon, and nothing else will be done  for him by the plant. If he desire to obtain some  substantial favour, he has it performed for him on  making his request, but then the Alraun will answer  no inquiries as to the future until the next day of  visitation shall arrive.
          Whoso has this wonder of the world in his possession  can never take harm from his foes, and  never sustain any loss. If he be poor, he at once  becomes rich. If his marriage be unblest by offspring,  he at once has children.
          If a piece of gold be laid beside the Alraun at  night, it is found to be doubled in the morning, and  so on for any sum whatsoever, but never has it been  known to be increased more than two pieces for  each one.
          On the demise of the owner only a youngest son  can inherit the Alraun. To inherit it effectually he  must place a loaf of white bread and a piece of  money in the coffin of his father, to be buried along  with his corpse. If he fail to do so, then is the possession,  like many others of great name in the  world, of no value to him. Should, however, the  youngest son fail before the father, then the Alraun  rightfully belongs to the eldest, but he must also  place bread and money in the coffin of his brother,  as well as in that of his father, to inherit it to any  purpose.
