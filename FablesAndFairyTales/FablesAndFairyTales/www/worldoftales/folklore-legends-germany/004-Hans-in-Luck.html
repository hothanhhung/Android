          Hans had served his master seven years, and at last  said to him&mdash;
          &quot;Master, my time is up; I should like to go home  and see my mother, so give me my wages.&quot;
          And the master said&mdash;
          &quot;You have been a faithful and good servant, so  your pay shall be handsome.&quot;
          Then he gave him a piece of silver that was as big  as his head. Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief,  put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his  shoulder, and jogged off homewards. As he went  lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man  came in sight, trotting along gaily on a capital  horse.
          &quot;Ah!&quot; said Hans aloud, &quot;what a fine thing it is  to ride on horseback! There he sits as if he were  at home in his chair. He trips against no stones,  spares his shoes, and yet gets on he hardly knows  how.&quot;
          The horseman heard this, and said&mdash;
          &quot;Well, Hans, why do you go on foot, then?&quot;
          &quot;Ah!&quot; said he, &quot;I have this load to carry; to be  sure, it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can't hold  up my head, and it hurts my shoulder sadly.&quot;
          &quot;What do you say to changing?&quot; said the horseman.  &quot;I will give you my horse, and you shall  give me the silver.&quot;
          &quot;With all my heart,&quot; said Hans, &quot;but I tell you  one thing: you will have a weary task to drag it  along.&quot;
          The horseman got off, took the silver, helped  Hans up, gave him the bridle into his hand, and  said&mdash;
          &quot;When you want to go very fast, you must smack  your lips loud and cry, 'Jip.'&quot;
          Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, and  rode merrily on. After a time he thought he should  like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and  cried &quot;Jip.&quot; Away went the horse full gallop, and  before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown  off, and lay in a ditch by the wayside, and his horse  would have run off if a shepherd, who was coming  by driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon  came to himself, and got upon his legs again. He  was sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd&mdash;
          &quot;This riding is no joke when a man gets on a  beast like this, that stumbles and flings him off as if  he would break his neck. However, I'm off now  once for all. I like your cow a great deal better;  one can walk along at one's leisure behind her, and  have milk, butter, and cheese every day into the  bargain. What would I give to have such a cow!&quot;
          &quot;Well,&quot; said the shepherd, &quot;if you are so fond of  her I will change my cow for your horse.&quot;
          &quot;Done!&quot; said Hans merrily.
          The shepherd jumped upon the horse and away  he rode. Hans drove off his cow quietly, and  thought his bargain a very lucky one.
          &quot;If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly  shall be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat  my butter and cheese with it, and when I am thirsty  I can milk my cow and drink the milk. What can I  wish for more?&quot; said he.
          When he came to an inn he halted, ate up all his  bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of  beer. Then he drove his cow towards his mother's  village. The heat grew greater as noon came on,  till at last he found himself on a wide heath that it  would take him more than an hour to cross, and he  began to be so hot and parched that his tongue  cleaved to the roof of his mouth.
          &quot;I can find a cure for this,&quot; thought he; &quot;now  will I milk my cow and quench my thirst.&quot; So he  tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his  leathern cap to milk into, but not a drop was to  be had.
          While he was trying his luck, and managing the  matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast gave him a  kick on the head that knocked him down, and there  he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher  came by driving a pig in a wheelbarrow.
          &quot;What is the matter with you?&quot; said the butcher,  as he helped him up.
          Hans told him what had happened, and the  butcher gave him a flask, saying&mdash;
          &quot;There, drink and refresh yourself. Your cow  will give you no milk; she is an old beast, good for  nothing but the slaughter-house.&quot;
          &quot;Alas, alas!&quot; said Hans, &quot;who would have  thought it? If I kill her, what will she be good  for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for  me. If it were a pig, now, one could do something  with it; it would at any rate make some sausages.&quot;
          &quot;Well,&quot; said the butcher, &quot;to please you I'll  change and give you the pig for the cow.&quot;
          &quot;Heaven reward you for your kindness!&quot; said  Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow and took the  pig off the wheelbarrow and drove it off, holding it  by a string tied to its leg.
          So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right  with him. He had met with some misfortunes, to be  sure, but he was now well repaid for all. The next  person he met was a countryman carrying a fine  white goose under his arm. The countryman  stopped to ask what was the hour, and Hans told  him all his luck, and how he had made so many good  bargains. The countryman said he was going to  take the goose to a christening.
          &quot;Feel,&quot; said he, &quot;how heavy it is, and yet it is  only eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it  may cut plenty of fat off, it has lived so well.&quot;
          &quot;You're right,&quot; said Hans, as he weighed it in  his hand; &quot;but my pig is no trifle.&quot;
          Meantime the countryman began to look grave,  and shook his head.
          &quot;Hark ye,&quot; said he, &quot;my good friend. Your pig  may get you into a scrape. In the village I have  just come from the squire has had a pig stolen out  of his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw  you that you had got the squire's pig. It will be  a bad job if they catch you, for the least they'll do  will be to throw you into the horse-pond.&quot;
          Poor Hans was sadly frightened.
          &quot;Good man,&quot; cried he, &quot;pray get me out of this  scrape. You know this country better than I; take  my pig and give me the goose.&quot;
          &quot;I ought to have something into the bargain,&quot;  said the countryman; &quot;however, I'll not bear hard  upon you, as you are in trouble.&quot;
          Then he took the string in his hand and drove  off the pig by a side path, while Hans went on his  way homeward free from care.
          &quot;After all,&quot; thought he, &quot;I have the best of the  bargain. First there will be a capital roast, then  the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months,  and then there are all the beautiful white feathers.  I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure  I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy  my mother will be!&quot;
          As he came to the last village he saw a scissors-grinder,  with his wheel, working away and singing&mdash;
          
             &quot;O'er hill and o'er dale so happy I roam,  Work light and live well, all the world is my home;  Who so blythe, so merry as I?&quot; 
          
          Hans stood looking for a while, and at last said&mdash;
          &quot;You must be well off, master grinder, you seem  so happy at your work.&quot;
          &quot;Yes,&quot; said the other, &quot;mine is a golden trade.  A good grinder never puts his hand in his pocket  without finding money in it&mdash;but where did you  get that beautiful goose?&quot;
          &quot;I did not buy it, but changed a pig for it.&quot;
          &quot;And where did you get the pig?&quot;
          &quot;I gave a cow for it.&quot;
          &quot;And the cow?&quot;
          &quot;I gave a horse for it.&quot;
          &quot;And the horse?&quot;
          &quot;I gave a piece of silver as big as my head for  that.&quot;
          &quot;And the silver?&quot;
          &quot;Oh! I worked hard for that seven long years.&quot;
          &quot;You have thriven well in the world hitherto,&quot;  said the grinder, &quot;now if you could find money in  your pocket whenever you put your hand into it  your fortune would be made.&quot;
          &quot;Very true, but how is that to be managed?&quot;
          &quot;You must turn grinder like me,&quot; said the other.  &quot;You only want a grindstone, the rest will come of  itself. Here is one that is only a little the worse  for wear. I would not ask more than the value of  your goose for it. Will you buy it?&quot;
          &quot;How can you ask such a question?&quot; said Hans.  &quot;I should be the happiest man in the world if I  could have money whenever I put my hand in my  pocket. What could I want more? There's the  goose.&quot;
          &quot;Now,&quot; said the grinder, as he gave him a  common rough stone that lay by his side, &quot;this is  a most capital stone. Do but manage it cleverly  and you can make an old nail cut with it.&quot;
          Hans took the stone, and went off with a light  heart. His eyes sparkled with joy, and he said to  himself&mdash;
          &quot;I must have been born in a lucky hour. Everything  I want or wish comes to me of itself.&quot;
          Meantime he began to be tired, for he had been  travelling ever since daybreak. He was hungry too,  for he had given away his last penny in his joy at  getting the cow. At last he could go no further,  and the stone tired him terribly, so he dragged himself  to the side of the pond that he might drink some  water and rest a while. He laid the stone carefully  by his side on the bank, but as he stooped down to  drink he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it  went, plump into the pond. For a while he watched  it sinking in the deep, clear water, then, sprang up  for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked  Heaven with tears in his eyes for its kindness in  taking away his only plague, the ugly, heavy stone.
          &quot;How happy am I!&quot; cried he; &quot;no mortal was  ever so lucky as I am.&quot;
          Then he got up with a light and merry heart, and  walked on, free from all his troubles, till he reached  his mother's house.
