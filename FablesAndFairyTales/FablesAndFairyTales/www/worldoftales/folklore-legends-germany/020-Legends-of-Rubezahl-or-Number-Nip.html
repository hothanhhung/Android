          Once upon a time a glazier who was travelling  across the mountains, feeling very tired from the  heavy load of glass which he was carrying, began to  look about to discover a place where he might rest  it. Rubezahl, who had been watching for some  time, no sooner saw this than he changed himself  into a little mound, which the glazier not long afterwards  discovered in his way, and on which, well  pleased, he proposed to seat himself. But his joy  was not of long continuance, for he had not sat  there many minutes before the heap vanished from  under him so rapidly, that the poor glazier fell to  the ground with his glass, which was by the fall  smashed into a thousand pieces.
          The poor fellow arose from the ground and  looked around him, but the mound of earth on  which he had before seated himself was no longer  visible. Then he began bitterly to lament, and to  sigh with heartfelt sorrow over his untoward fate.  At length he started once more on his journey.  Upon this Rubezahl, assuming the appearance of a  traveller, accosted him, and inquired why he so  lamented, and what was the great sorrow with which  he was afflicted. The glazier related to him the  whole affair, how that, being weary, he had seated  himself upon a mound by the wayside, how this had  suddenly overthrown him, and broken to pieces his  whole stock of glass, which was well worth eight  dollars, and how, in short, the mound itself had  suddenly disappeared. He declared that he knew  not in the least how to recover his loss and bring  the business to a good ending. The compassionate  mountain sprite comforted him, told him who he  was, and that he himself had played him the trick,  and at the same time bade him be of good cheer, for  his losses should be made good to him.
          Upon this Rubezahl transformed himself into an  ass, and directed the glazier to sell him at the mill  which lay at the foot of the mountain, and to be  sure to make off with the purchase-money as quickly  as possible. The glazier accordingly immediately  bestrode the transformed mountain sprite, and rode  him down the mountain to the mill, where he  offered him for sale to the miller at the price of ten  dollars. The miller offered nine, and the glazier,  without further haggling, took the money and went  his way.
          When he was gone the miller sent his newly  purchased beast to the stable, and the boy who had  charge of him immediately filled his rack with hay.  Upon this Rubezahl exclaimed&mdash;
          &quot;I don't eat hay. I eat nothing but roasted and  boiled, and that of the best.&quot;
          The boy's hair stood on end. He flew to his  master, and related to him this wondrous tale, and  he no sooner heard it than he hastened to the stable  and there found nothing, for his ass and his nine  dollars were alike vanished.
          But the miller was rightly served, for he had  cheated in his time many poor people, therefore  Rubezahl punished in this manner the injustice of  which he had been guilty.
          
          In the year 1512 a man of noble family, who  was a very tyrant and oppressor, had commanded  one of his vassals or peasants to carry home with his  horses and cart an oak of extraordinary magnitude,  and threatened to visit him with the heaviest disgrace  and punishment if he neglected to fulfil his  desires. The peasant saw that it was impossible  for him to execute the command of his lord, and  fled to the woods with great sorrow and lamentation.
          There he was accosted by Rubezahl, who appeared  to him like a man, and inquired of him the cause  of his so great sorrow and affliction. Upon this the  peasant related to him all the circumstances of the  case. When Rubezahl heard it he bade him be of  good cheer and care not, but go home to his house  again, as he himself would soon transport the oak,  as his lord required, into his courtyard.
          Scarcely had the peasant got well home again  before Rubezahl took the monstrous oak-tree, with  its thick and sturdy boughs, and hurled it into the  courtyard of the nobleman, and with its huge stem,  and its many thick branches, so choked and blocked  up the entrance that no one could get either in or  out. And because the oak proved harder than their  iron tools, and could in no manner or wise, and  with no power which they could apply to it, be  hewn or cut in pieces, the nobleman was compelled  to break through the walls in another part of the  courtyard, and have a new doorway made, which  was only done with great labour and expense.
          
          Once upon a time Rubezahl made, from what  materials is not known, a quantity of pigs, which  he drove to the neighbouring market and sold to  a peasant, with a caution that the purchaser should  not drive them through any water.
          Now, what happened? Why these same swine  having chanced to get sadly covered with mire, what  must the peasant do, but drive them to the river,  which they had no sooner entered than the pigs  suddenly became wisps of straw, and were carried  away by the stream. The purchaser was, moreover,  obliged to put up with the loss, for he could neither  find his pigs again, nor could he discover the person  from whom he had bought them.
          
          Rubezahl once betook himself to the Hirschberg,  which is in the neighbourhood of his forest haunts,  and there offered his services as a woodcutter to one  of the townsmen, asking for his remuneration nothing  more than a bundle of wood. This the man promised  him, accepting his offer, and pointed out some  cart-loads, intending to give him some assistance. To  this offer of help in his labours Rubezahl replied&mdash;
          &quot;No. It is quite unnecessary. All that is to be  done I can very well accomplish by myself.&quot;
          Upon this his new master made a few further  inquiries, asking him what sort of a hatchet he had  got, for he had noticed that his supposed servant  was without one.
          &quot;Oh,&quot; said Rubezahl, &quot;I'll soon get a hatchet.&quot;
          Accordingly he laid hands upon his left leg, and  pulled that and his foot and all off at the thigh, and  with it cut, as if he had been raving mad, all the  wood into small pieces of proper lengths and sizes  in about a quarter of an hour, thus proving that a  dismembered foot is a thousand times more effectual  for such purposes than the sharpest axe.
          In the meanwhile the owner (who saw plainly  that mischief was intended) kept calling upon the  wondrous woodcutter to desist and go about his  business. Rubezahl, however, kept incessantly  answering&mdash;
          &quot;No, I won't stir from this spot until I have  hewn the wood as small as I agreed to, and have got  my wages for so doing.&quot;
          In the midst of such quarrelling Rubezahl finished  his job, and screwed his leg on again, for while at  work he had been standing on one leg, after the  fashion of a stork. Then he gathered together  into one bundle all he had cut, placed it on his  shoulder, and started off with it towards his favourite  retreat, heedless of the tears and lamentations of  his master.
          On this occasion Rubezahl did not appear in the  character of a sportive or mischievous spirit, but as  an avenger of injustice, for his employer had induced  a number of poor men to bring wood to his home  upon the promise of paying them wages, which,  however, he had never paid them. Rubezahl laid  at the door of each of these poor men as much of  the wood he carried away as would repay them, and  so the business was brought to a proper termination.
          
          It once happened that a messenger vexed or  played some trick upon Rubezahl, who thereupon  revenged himself in the following manner, and so  wiped out the score.
          The messenger, in one of his journeys over the  mountains, entered an hotel to refresh himself, and  placed his spear as usual behind the door. No  sooner had he done so than Rubezahl carried off the  spear, transformed himself into a similar one, and  took its place.
          When the messenger, after taking his rest, set  forth again with the spear, and had got some little  way on his journey, it began slipping about every  now and then in such a manner that the messenger  began pitching forward into the most intolerable  mire, and got himself sadly bespattered. It did this  so often that at last he could not tell for the soul of  him what had come to the spear, or why he kept  slipping forward with it instead of seizing fast hold  of the ground.
          He looked at it longways and sideways, from  above, from underneath, but in spite of all his  attempts, no change could he discover.
          After this inspection he went forward a little way,  when suddenly he was once more plunged into the  morass, and commenced crying&mdash;
          &quot;Woe is me! woe is me!&quot; at his spear, which led  him into such scrapes, and did nothing to release  him from them. At length he got himself once  more to rights, and then he turned the spear the  wrong way upwards. No sooner had he done so  than he was driven backwards instead of forwards,  and so got into a worse plight than ever.
          After this he laid the spear across his shoulder  like a pikeman, since it was no use to trail it upon  the earth, and in this fashion he started on. But  Rubezahl continued his tricks by pressing on the  messenger as though he had got a yoke on his back.  He changed the spear from one shoulder to the  other, until at last, from very weariness, he threw  away the bewitched weapon, imagining that the  Evil One must possess it, and went his way without  it.
          He had not proceeded above a quarter of a mile,  when, looking carelessly about him, he was astounded  to find his spear by his side. He was sadly  frightened, and little knew what to make of it. At  last he boldly ventured to lay hands upon it. He  did so, and lifted it up, but he could not conceive  how he should carry it. He had no desire to trail  it any more on the ground, and the thought of  carrying it on his shoulder made him shudder. He  decided, however, to give it another trial, carrying  it in his hand. Fresh troubles now arose. The  spear weighed so heavy that he could not stir it a  foot from the spot, and though he tried first one  hand and then another, all his efforts were in vain.
          At last he bethought him of riding upon the spear,  as a child bestrides a stick. A wonderful change  now came over the weapon. It ran on as though it  had been a fleet horse, and thus mounted the  messenger rode on without ceasing until he  descended the mountain and came into the city,  where he excited the wonder, delight, and laughter  of the worthy burghers.
          Although he had endured some trouble in the  early part of his journey, the messenger thought he  had been amply compensated at the close, and he  comforted himself by making up his mind that in all  future journeys he was destined to perform he would  bestride his nimble spear. His good intentions  were, however, frustrated. Rubezahl had played his  game, and had had all the amusement he desired  with the poor knave. Accordingly he scampered  away, leaving in his place the real spear, which never  played any more tricks, but, after the old fashion of  other spears, accompanied its master in a becoming  and orderly style.
          
          A poor woman, who got her living by gathering  herbs, once went, accompanied by her two children,  to the mountains, carrying with her a basket in  which to gather the plants, which she was in the  habit of disposing of to the apothecaries. Having  chanced to discover a large tract of land covered  with such plants as were most esteemed, she busied  herself so in filling her basket that she lost her  way, and was troubled to find out how to get back  to the path from which she had wandered. On a  sudden a man dressed like a peasant appeared before  her, and said&mdash;
          &quot;Well, good woman, what is it you are looking  for so anxiously? and where do you want to go?&quot;
          &quot;Alas!&quot; replied she, &quot;I am a poor woman who  has neither bit nor sup, for which reason I am  obliged to wander to gather herbs, so that I may  buy bread for myself and my hungry children. I  have lost my way, and cannot find it. I pray you,  good man, take pity on me, and lead me out of the  thicket into the right path, so that I may make the  best of my way home.&quot;
          &quot;Well, my good woman,&quot; replied Rubezahl, for  it was he, &quot;make yourself happy. I will show you  the way. But what good are those roots to you?  They will be of little benefit. Throw away this  rubbish, and gather from this tree as many leaves  as will fill your basket; you will find them answer  your purpose much better.&quot;
          &quot;Alas!&quot; said the woman, &quot;who would give a  penny for them? They are but common leaves, and  good for nothing.&quot;
          &quot;Be advised, my good woman,&quot; said Rubezahl;  &quot;throw away those you have got, and follow me.&quot;
          He repeated his injunction over and over again  in vain, until he got tired, for the woman would  not be persuaded. At last, he fairly laid hold of  the basket, threw the herbs out by main force, and  supplied their place with leaves from the surrounding  bushes. When he had finished, he told the  woman to go home, and led her into the right path.
          The woman, with her children and her basket,  journeyed on some distance; but they had not gone  far before she saw some valuable herbs growing by  the wayside. No sooner did she perceive them  than she longed to gather them, for she hoped that  she should obtain something for them, while the  leaves with which her basket was crammed were,  she thought, good for nothing. She accordingly  emptied her basket, throwing away the rubbish, as  she esteemed it, and having filled it once more with  roots, journeyed on to her dwelling at Kirschdorf.
          As soon as she arrived at her home she cleansed  the roots she had gathered from the earth which  clung around them, tied them neatly together,  and emptied everything out of the basket. Upon  doing this, something glittering caught her eye,  and she commenced to make a careful examination  of the basket. She was surprised to discover several  ducats sticking to the wickerwork, and these were  clearly such of the leaves as remained of those  which she had so thoughtlessly thrown away on  the mountains.
          She rejoiced at having preserved what she had,  but she was again sorely vexed that she had not  taken care of all that the mountain spirit had  gathered for her. She hastened back to the spot  where she had emptied the basket, in hopes of  finding some of the leaves there; but her search  was in vain&mdash;they had all vanished.
