          There was once a woman who had a little son of  about seven years old, who was so lovely and beautiful  that no one could look upon him without being  kind to him, and he was dearer to her than all the  world beside. It happened that he suddenly fell ill  and died, and his mother would not be comforted,  but wept for him day and night. Shortly after he  was buried he showed himself at night in the places  where he had been used in his lifetime to sit and  play, and if his mother wept, he wept also, and when  the morning came he departed. Since his mother  never ceased weeping, the child came one night in  the little white shroud in which he had been laid in  his coffin, and with the chaplet upon his head, and  seating himself at her feet, upon the bed, he  cried&mdash;
          &quot;O mother, mother, give over crying, else I cannot  stop in my coffin, for my shroud is never dry  because of your tears, for they fall upon it.&quot;
          When his mother heard this she was sore afraid,  and wept no more. And the babe came upon  another night, holding in his hand a little taper, and  he said&mdash;
          &quot;Look, mother, my shroud is now quite dry, and  I can rest in my grave.&quot;
          Then she bowed to the will of Providence, and  bore her sorrow with silence and patience, and the  little child returned not again, but slept in his  underground bed.
