          It is commonly believed in Germany that on St.  Andrew's night, St. Thomas' night, and Christmas  and New Year's nights, a girl has the power of  inviting and seeing her future lover. A table is to  be laid for two persons, taking care, however, that  there are no forks upon it. Whatever the lover  leaves behind him must be carefully preserved, for  he then returns to her who has it, and loves her  passionately. The article must, however, be kept  carefully concealed from his sight, for he would  otherwise remember the torture of superhuman  power exercised over him which he that night  endured, become conscious of the charms employed,  and this would lead to fatal consequences.
          A fair maiden in Austria once sought at midnight,  after performing the necessary ceremonies, to obtain  a sight of her lover, whereupon a shoemaker appeared  having a dagger in his hand, which he threw at her  and then disappeared. She picked up the dagger  which he had thrown at her and concealed it in a  trunk.
           Not long afterwards the shoemaker visited, courted,  and married her. Some years after her marriage  she chanced to go one Sunday about the hour of  vespers to the trunk in search of something that she  required for her work the next day. As she opened  the trunk her husband came to her, and would insist  on looking into it. She kept him off, until at last  he pushed her away, and there saw his long-lost  dagger. He immediately seized it, and demanded  how she obtained it, because he had lost it at a very  particular time. In her fear and alarm she had not  the power to invent any excuse, so declared the  truth, that it was the same dagger he had left  behind him the night when she had obliged him to  appear to her. Her husband hereupon grew enraged,  and said, with a terrible voice&mdash;
          &quot;'Twas you, then, that caused me that night of  dreadful misery?&quot;
          With that he thrust the dagger into her heart.
