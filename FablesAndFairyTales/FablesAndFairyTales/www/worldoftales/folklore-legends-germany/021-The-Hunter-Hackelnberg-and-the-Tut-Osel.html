          The Wild Huntsman, Hackelnberg, traverses the  Hartz mountains and the Thuringian forest, but he  seems mostly to prefer the Hakel, from which place  he derives his name, and especially the neighbourhood  of Dummburg. Ofttimes is he heard at night,  in rain and storm, when the moonlight is breaking  by fits and starts through the troubled sky, following  with his hounds the shadows of the wild beasts  he slew in days of yore. His retinue generally  proceed from the Dummburg, straight over the  Hakel to the now desolate village of Ammendorf.
          He has only been seen by a few children, who,  having been born on a Sunday, had the power of  seeing spirits. Sometimes he met them as a lonely  huntsman, accompanied by one solitary hound.  Sometimes he was seen in a carriage drawn by four  horses, and followed by six dogs of the chase. But  many have heard the low bellowing of his hounds,  and the splashing of his horse's feet in the swamps  of the moor; many have heard his cry of &quot;Hu!  hu!&quot; and seen his associate and forerunner&mdash;the  Tut-Osel, or Tooting Ursula.
          Once upon a time three wanderers seated themselves  in the neighbourhood of the Dummburg.  The night was already far advanced. The moon  gleamed faintly through the chasing clouds. All  around was still. Suddenly they heard something  rush along over their heads. They looked up, and  an immense screech-owl flew before them.
          &quot;Ha!&quot; cried one of them, &quot;there is the Tut-Osel!  Hackelnberg, the Wild Huntsman, is not  far off.&quot;
          &quot;Let us fly,&quot; exclaimed the second, &quot;before the  spirits overtake us.&quot;
          &quot;We cannot fly,&quot; said the third; &quot;but you have  nothing to fear if you do not irritate him. Lay  yourselves down upon your faces when he passes  over us. But, remember, you must not think of  addressing Hackelnberg, lest he treat you as he  treated the shepherd.&quot;
          The wanderers laid themselves under the bushes.  Presently they heard around them the rushing by,  as it were, of a whole pack of hounds, and high in  the air above them they heard a hollow sound like  that of a hunted beast of the forest, and ever and  anon they trembled at hearing the fearful-toned  voice of the Wild Huntsman uttering his well-known  &quot;Hu! hu!&quot; Two of the wanderers pressed  close to the earth, but the third could not resist  his inclination to have a peep at what was going  on. He looked up slantingly through the branches,  and saw the shadow of a huntsman pass directly  over him.
          Suddenly all around was hushed. The wanderers  rose slowly and timidly, and looked after Hackelnberg;  but he had vanished, and did not return.
          &quot;But who is the Tut-Osel?&quot; inquired the second  wanderer, after a long pause.
          &quot;In a distant nunnery in Thuringia,&quot; replied the  first, &quot;there once lived a nun named Ursula, who,  even during her lifetime, tormented all the sisterhood  by her discordant voice, and oftentimes interrupted  the service of the church, for which reason  they called her Tut-Osel, or Tooting Ursula. If  matters were bad while she lived, they became far  worse when she died. At eleven o'clock every  night she now thrust her head through a hole in  the convent tower and tooted most miserably, and  every morning at about four o'clock she joined unasked  in the matin song.
          &quot;For a few days the sisterhood endured this  with a beating heart, and on bended knees; but on  the fourth morning, when she joined in the service,  and one of the nuns whispered tremblingly to her  neighbour&mdash;
          &quot;'Ha! it is surely our Tut-Osel!' the song  ceased, the hair of the nuns stood on end, and they  all rushed from the church, exclaiming&mdash;
          &quot;'Ha! Tut-Osel! Tut-Osel!'
          &quot;Despite the penances and chastisements with  which they were threatened, not one of the nuns  would enter the church again until the Tut-Osel  was banished from the walls of the nunnery. To  effect this, one of the most celebrated exorcists of  the day, a Capuchin friar, from a cloister on the  banks of the Danube, was sent for; and he succeeded,  by prayer and fasting, in banishing Ursel  in the shape of a screech-owl to the far-distant  Dummburg.
          &quot;Here she met Hackelnberg, the Wild Huntsman,  and found in his wood-cry, 'Hu! hu!' as  great delight as he did in her 'U! hu!' So they  now always hunt together; he glad to have a spirit  after his own kind, and she rejoiced in the extreme  to be no longer compelled to reside within the  walls of a cloister, and there listen to the echo of  her own song.&quot;
          &quot;So much for the Tut-Osel. Now tell us  how it fared with the shepherd who spoke to  Hackelnberg.&quot;
          &quot;Listen to the marvellous adventure,&quot; said the  third wanderer. &quot;A shepherd once hearing the  Wild Huntsman journeying through the forest, encouraged  the spirit hounds, and called out&mdash;
          &quot;'Good sport to you, Hackelnberg.'
          &quot;Hackelnberg instantly turned round and roared  out to him, in a voice like thunder&mdash;
          &quot;'Since you have helped me to set on the hounds,  you shall have part of the spoil.'
          &quot;The trembling shepherd tried to hide himself,  but Hackelnberg hurled the half-consumed haunch  of a horse into the shepherd's cart with such  violence that it could scarcely be removed.&quot;
