          An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a  faithful hard-working slave to him for a great many  years, but was now growing old, and every day  more and more unfit for work. His master therefore  was tired of keeping him to live at ease like a  gentleman, and so began to think of putting an end  to him. The ass, who was a shrewd hand, saw that  some mischief was in the wind, so he took himself  slily off, and began his journey towards Bremen.
          &quot;There,&quot; thought he to himself, &quot;as I have a  good voice, I may chance to be chosen town  musician.&quot;
          After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog  lying by the roadside, and panting as if very tired.
          &quot;What makes you pant so, my friend?&quot; said the  ass.
          &quot;Alas!&quot; said the dog, &quot;my master was going to  knock me on the head, because I am old and weak,  and can no longer make myself useful to him in  hunting, so I ran away. But what can I do to  earn my livelihood?&quot;
          &quot;Hark ye,&quot; said the ass, &quot;I am going to Bremen  to turn musician. Come with me, and try what  you can do in the same way.&quot;
          The dog said he was willing, and on they went.
          They had not gone far before they saw a cat  sitting in the middle of the road, with tears in her  eyes, and making a most rueful face.
          &quot;Pray, my good lady,&quot; said the ass, &quot;what's  the matter with you? You look quite out of  spirits.&quot;
          &quot;Ah, me!&quot; said the cat. &quot;How can a body be  in good spirits when one's life is in danger? Because  I am beginning to grow old, and had rather  lie at my ease before the fire than run about the  house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me,  and was going to drown me, and though I have  been lucky enough to get away from her, I know  not how I am to live.&quot;
          &quot;Oh!&quot; said the ass, &quot;by all means go with us to  Bremen. You are a good night-singer, and may  make your fortune as one of the waits.&quot;
          The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined  the party. Soon afterwards, as they were passing  by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate,  screaming out with all his might and main.
          &quot;Bravo!&quot; said the ass. &quot;Upon my word, you  make a famous noise. Pray, what is all this about?&quot;
          &quot;Why,&quot; said the cock, &quot;I was just now telling  all our neighbours that we were to have fine weather  for our washing-day; and yet my mistress and the  cook don't thank me for my pains, but threaten to  cut my head off to-morrow, and make broth of me  for the guests that are coming on Sunday.&quot;
          &quot;Heaven forbid!&quot; said the ass. &quot;Come with us.  Anything will be better than staying here. Besides,  who knows, if we take care to sing in tune, we may  get up a concert of our own, so come along with us.&quot;
          &quot;With all my heart,&quot; replied the cock; so they  all four went on jollily together towards Bremen.
          They could not, however, reach the town the first  day, so when night came on they turned off the  high-road into a wood to sleep. The ass and the  dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and  the cat climbed up into the branches; while the  cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he  should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and  then, according to his custom, before he sounded his  trumpet and went to sleep, looked out on all sides  to see that everything was well. In doing this he  saw afar off something bright, and calling to his  companions, said&mdash;
          &quot;There must be a house no great way off, for I  see a light.&quot;
          &quot;If that be the case,&quot; replied the ass, &quot;we had  better change our quarters, for our lodging here is  not the best in the world.&quot;
          &quot;Besides,&quot; said the dog, &quot;I should not be the  worse for a bone or two.&quot;
          &quot;And may be,&quot; remarked the cat, &quot;a stray mouse  will be found somewhere about the premises.&quot;
          So they walked off together towards the spot  where the cock had seen the light; and as they  drew near, it became larger and brighter, till they  came at last to a lonely house, in which was a gang  of robbers.
          The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched  up to the window and peeped in.
          &quot;Well,&quot; said the cock, &quot;what do you see?&quot;
          &quot;What do I see?&quot; replied the ass. &quot;Why, I see  a table spread with all kinds of good things, and  robbers sitting round it making merry.&quot;
          &quot;That would be a noble lodging for us,&quot; said the  cock.
          &quot;Yes,&quot; rejoined the ass, &quot;if we could only get  in.&quot;
          They laid their heads together to see how they  could get the robbers out, and at last they hit upon  a plan. The ass set himself upright on his hind-legs,  with his fore-feet resting on the window; the  dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the  dog's shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon  the cat. When all were ready the cock gave the  signal, and up struck the whole band of music. The  ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the  cock crew. Then they all broke through the window  at once, and came tumbling into the room amongst  the broken glass, with a hideous clatter. The  robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the  opening concert, had now no doubt that some  frightful hobgoblins had broken in upon them, and  scampered away as fast as they could.
          The coast once clear, the travellers soon sat down  and despatched what the robbers had left, with as  much eagerness as if they had not hoped to eat  again for a month. As soon as they had had  enough they put out the lights, and each once  more sought out a resting-place to his liking. The  donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in  the yard; the dog stretched himself upon a mat  behind the door; the cat rolled herself up on the  hearth before the warm ashes; the cock perched  upon a beam on the top of the house; and as all  were rather tired with their journey, they soon fell  fast asleep.
          About midnight, however, when the robbers saw  from afar that the lights were out and that all was  quiet, they began to think that they had been in  too great a hurry to run away; and one of them,  who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was  going on. Finding everything still, he marched  into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a  match in order to light a candle. Espying the  glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for  live coals, and held the match to them to light it.  The cat, however, not understanding such a joke,  sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched him.  This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to  the back door, where the dog jumped up and bit  him in the leg. As he was crossing over the yard  the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been  awakened by the noise, crew with all his might.
          At this the robber ran back as fast as he could  to his comrades, and told the captain that a horrid  witch had got into the house, and had scratched his  face with her long bony fingers&mdash;that a man with a  knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the  door, and stabbed him in the leg&mdash;that a black  monster stood in the yard and struck him with a  club&mdash;and that the devil sat upon the top of the  house, and cried out&mdash;
          &quot;Throw the rascal up here!&quot;
          After this the robbers never dared to go back to  the house; but the musicians were so pleased with  their quarters, that they never found their way to  Bremen, but took up their abode in the wood. And  there they live, I dare say, to this very day.
