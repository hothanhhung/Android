          It once happened that Paracelsus was walking  through a forest, when he heard a voice calling to  him by name. He looked around, and at length  discovered that it proceeded from a fir-tree, in the  trunk of which there was a spirit enclosed by a  small stopper, sealed with three crosses.
          The spirit begged of Paracelsus to set him free.  This he readily promised, on condition that the  spirit should bestow upon him a medicine capable  of healing all diseases, and a tincture which would  turn everything it touched to gold. The spirit  acceded to his request, whereupon Paracelsus took  his penknife, and succeeded, after some trouble, in  getting out the stopper. A loathsome black spider  crept forth, which ran down the trunk of the tree.  Scarcely had it reached the ground before it was  changed, and became, as if rising from the earth, a  tall haggard man, with squinting red eyes, wrapped  in a scarlet mantle.
          He led Paracelsus to a high, overhanging, craggy  mount, and with a hazel twig, which he had broken  off by the way, he smote the rock, which, splitting  with a crash at the blow, divided itself in twain,  and the spirit disappeared within it. He, however,  soon returned with two small phials, which he  handed to Paracelsus&mdash;a yellow one, containing the  tincture which turned all it touched to gold, and  a white one, holding the medicine which healed all  diseases. He then smote the rock a second time,  and thereupon it instantly closed again.
          Both now set forth on their return, the spirit  directing his course towards Innspr&uuml;ck, to seize  upon the magician who had banished him from that  city. Now Paracelsus trembled for the consequences  which his releasing the Evil One would  entail upon him who had conjured him into the  tree, and bethought how he might rescue him.  When they arrived once more at the fir-tree, he  asked the spirit if he could possibly transform himself  again into a spider, and let him see him creep  into the hole. The spirit said that it was not only  possible, but that he would be most happy to make  such a display of his art for the gratification of his  deliverer.
          Accordingly he once more assumed the form  of a spider, and crept again into the well-known  crevice. When he had done so, Paracelsus, who  had kept the stopper all ready in his hand for the  purpose, clapped it as quick as lightning into the hole,  hammered it in firmly with a stone, and with his  knife made three fresh crosses upon it. The spirit,  mad with rage, shook the fir-tree as though with a  whirlwind, that he might drive out the stopper  which Paracelsus had thrust in, but his fury was of  no avail. It held fast, and left him there with  little hope of escape, for, on account of the great  drifts of snow from the mountains, the forest will  never be cut down, and, although he should call  night and day, nobody in that neighbourhood ever  ventures near the spot.
          Paracelsus, however, found that the phials were  such as he had demanded, and it was by their  means that he afterwards became such a celebrated  and distinguished man.
