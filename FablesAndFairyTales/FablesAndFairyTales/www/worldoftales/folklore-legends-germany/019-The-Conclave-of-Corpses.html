          Some three hundred years since, when the convent  of Kreutzberg was in its glory, one of the monks  who dwelt therein, wishing to ascertain something  of the hereafter of those whose bodies lay all undecayed  in the cemetery, visited it alone in the  dead of night for the purpose of prosecuting his  inquiries on that fearful subject. As he opened the  trap-door of the vault a light burst from below;  but deeming it to be only the lamp of the sacristan,  the monk drew back and awaited his departure  concealed behind the high altar. The sacristan  emerged not, however, from the opening; and the  monk, tired of waiting, approached, and finally descended  the rugged steps which led into the dreary  depths. No sooner had he set foot on the lowermost  stair, than the well-known scene underwent a  complete transformation in his eyes. He had long  been accustomed to visit the vault, and whenever  the sacristan went thither, he was almost sure to be  with him. He therefore knew every part of it as  well as he did the interior of his own narrow cell,  and the arrangement of its contents was perfectly  familiar to his eyes. What, then, was his horror to  perceive that this arrangement, which even but that  morning had come under his observation as usual,  was altogether altered, and a new and wonderful  one substituted in its stead.
          A dim lurid light pervaded the desolate abode of  darkness, and it just sufficed to give to his view a  sight of the most singular description.
          On each side of him the dead but imperishable  bodies of the long-buried brothers of the convent  sat erect in their lidless coffins, their cold, starry  eyes glaring at him with lifeless rigidity, their  withered fingers locked together on their breasts,  their stiffened limbs motionless and still. It was a  sight to petrify the stoutest heart; and the monk's  quailed before it, though he was a philosopher, and  a sceptic to boot. At the upper end of the vault,  at a rude table formed of a decayed coffin, or something  which once served the same purpose, sat  three monks. They were the oldest corses in the  charnel-house, for the inquisitive brother knew their  faces well; and the cadaverous hue of their cheeks  seemed still more cadaverous in the dim light shed  upon them, while their hollow eyes gave forth what  looked to him like flashes of flame. A large book  lay open before one of them, and the others bent  over the rotten table as if in intense pain, or in  deep and fixed attention. No word was said; no  sound was heard; the vault was as silent as the  grave, its awful tenants still as statues.
          Fain would the curious monk have receded from this  horrible place; fain would he have retraced his steps  and sought again his cell; fain would he have shut  his eyes to the fearful scene; but he could not stir  from the spot, he felt rooted there; and though he  once succeeded in turning his eyes to the entrance  of the vault, to his infinite surprise and dismay he  could not discover where it lay, nor perceive any  possible means of exit. He stood thus for some time.  At length the aged monk at the table beckoned him  to advance. With slow tottering steps he made his  way to the group, and at length stood in front of  the table, while the other monks raised their heads  and glanced at him with a fixed, lifeless look that  froze the current of his blood. He knew not what  to do; his senses were fast forsaking him; Heaven  seemed to have deserted him for his incredulity.  In this moment of doubt and fear he bethought  him of a prayer, and as he proceeded he felt himself  becoming possessed of a confidence he had before  unknown. He looked on the book before him. It  was a large volume, bound in black, and clasped  with bands of gold, with fastenings of the same  metal. It was inscribed at the top of each page
          &quot;Liber Obedienti&aelig;.&quot;
          He could read no further. He then looked, first  in the eyes of him before whom it lay open, and  then in those of his fellows. He finally glanced  around the vault on the corpses who filled every  visible coffin in its dark and spacious womb. Speech  came to him, and resolution to use it. He addressed  himself to the awful beings in whose presence he  stood, in the words of one having authority with  them.
          &quot;Pax vobis,&quot; 'twas thus he spake&mdash;&quot;Peace be to  ye.&quot;
          &quot;Hic nulla pax,&quot; replied an aged monk, in a hollow,  tremulous tone, baring his breast the while&mdash;&quot;Here  is no peace.&quot;
          He pointed to his bosom as he spoke, and the  monk, casting his eye upon it, beheld his heart  within surrounded by living fire, which seemed to  feed on it but not consume it. He turned away in  affright, but ceased not to prosecute his inquiries.
          &quot;Pax vobis, in nomine Domini,&quot; he spake again&mdash;&quot;Peace  be to ye, in the name of the Lord.&quot;
          &quot;Hic non pax,&quot; the hollow and heartrending  tones of the ancient monk who sat at the right of  the table were heard to answer.
          On glancing at the bared bosom of this hapless  being also the same sight was exhibited&mdash;the  heart surrounded by a devouring flame, but still  remaining fresh and unconsumed under its operation.  Once more the monk turned away and addressed  the aged man in the centre.
          &quot;Pax vobis, in nomine Domini,&quot; he proceeded.
           At these words the being to whom they were  addressed raised his head, put forward his hand,  and closing the book with a loud clap, said&mdash;
          &quot;Speak on. It is yours to ask, and mine to  answer.&quot;
          The monk felt reassured, and his courage rose  with the occasion.
          &quot;Who are ye?&quot; he inquired; &quot;who may ye be?&quot;
          &quot;We know not!&quot; was the answer, &quot;alas! we  know not!&quot;
          &quot;We know not, we know not!&quot; echoed in melancholy  tones the denizens of the vault.
          &quot;What do ye here?&quot; pursued the querist.
          &quot;We await the last day, the day of the last  judgment! Alas for us! woe! woe!&quot;
          &quot;Woe! woe!&quot; resounded on all sides.
          The monk was appalled, but still he proceeded.
          &quot;What did ye to deserve such doom as this?  What may your crime be that deserves such dole  and sorrow?&quot;
          As he asked the question the earth shook  under him, and a crowd of skeletons uprose from  a range of graves which yawned suddenly at his  feet.
          &quot;These are our victims,&quot; answered the old monk.  &quot;They suffered at our hands. We suffer now, while  they are at peace; and we shall suffer.&quot;
          &quot;For how long?&quot; asked the monk.
          &quot;For ever and ever!&quot; was the answer.
          &quot;For ever and ever, for ever and ever!&quot; died along  the vault.
          &quot;May God have mercy on us!&quot; was all the monk  could exclaim.
          The skeletons vanished, the graves closing over  them. The aged men disappeared from his view,  the bodies fell back in their coffins, the light fled,  and the den of death was once more enveloped in  its usual darkness.
          On the monk's revival he found himself lying at  the foot of the altar. The grey dawn of a spring  morning was visible, and he was fain to retire to his  cell as secretly as he could, for fear he should be  discovered.
          From thenceforth he eschewed vain philosophy,  says the legend, and, devoting his time to the pursuit  of true knowledge, and the extension of the  power, greatness, and glory of the Church, died in  the odour of sanctity, and was buried in that holy  vault, where his body is still visible.
          Requiescat in pace!
