          The happy day at length arrived on which Count  Hermann von Rosenberg was married to his beloved  Catherine, a princess of the house of Gonzaca. The  event was celebrated by a magnificent banquet and  festival, and it was late before the Count and Countess  could leave their guests. The young Countess was  already asleep, and Hermann was sinking into a  slumber, when he was aroused by hearing the sounds  of soft and gentle music, and, the door of his apartment  flying open, a joyous bridal procession entered  the room. The figures engaged in this extraordinary  scene were not more than two or three spans high.  The bride and bridegroom were in the centre of the  procession, and the musicians preceded it.
          Hermann rose up in bed, and demanded what  brought them there, and why they had aroused him,  whereupon one of the company stepped up to him,  and said&mdash;
          &quot;We are attendant spirits of that peaceful class  who dwell in the earth. We have dwelt for many  years beneath this thy birthplace, and have ever  watched over thy dwelling to preserve it from misfortune.  Already have we taken good care of the  ashes of your forefathers that they should not fall  into the power of hostile and evil spirits, and as  faithful servants we watch over the welfare of your  house. Since thou hast this day been married for  the continuance of thy name and ancient race, we  have represented to you this bridal ceremony, in  hopes that you will grant us full permission to keep  and celebrate this joyous festival, in return for which  we promise to serve you and your house with the  greatest readiness.&quot;
          &quot;Very well,&quot; said Hermann, laughing; &quot;make  yourselves as merry in my castle as you please.&quot;
          They thanked him, and took their departure.  Hermann could not, however, banish from his mind  this remarkable scene, and it was daybreak before  he fell asleep. In the morning his thoughts were  still occupied with it, yet he never mentioned one  word of the occurrence to his wife.
          In the course of time the Countess presented him  with a daughter. Scarcely had Hermann received  intelligence of this event before a very diminutive old  crone entered the apartment and informed him that  the elfin bride, whom he had seen in the miniature  procession on the night of his nuptials, had given  birth to a daughter. Hermann was very friendly  to the visitor, wished all happiness to the mother  and child, and the old woman took her departure.  The Count did not, however, mention this visit to  his wife.
          A year afterwards, on the approach of her second  confinement, the Countess saw the elves on the  occasion of her husband receiving another of their  unexpected visits. The little people entered the  chamber in a long procession in black dresses,  carrying lights in their hands, and the little women  were clothed in white. One of these stood before  the Count holding up her apron, while an old man  thus addressed her&mdash;
          &quot;No more, dear Hermann, can we find a resting-place  in your castle. We must wander abroad.  We are come to take our departure from you.&quot;
          &quot;Wherefore will you leave my castle?&quot; inquired  Hermann. &quot;Have I offended you?&quot;
          &quot;No, thou hast not; but we must go, for she  whom you saw as a bride on your wedding-night  lost, last evening, her life in giving birth to an heir,  who likewise perished. As a proof that we are  thankful for the kindness you have always shown  us, take a trifling proof of our power.&quot;
          When the old man had thus spoken, he placed a  little ladder against the bed, which the old woman  who had stood by ascended. Then she opened her  apron, held it before Hermann, and said&mdash;
          &quot;Grasp and take.&quot;
          He hesitated. She repeated what she had said.  At last he did what she told him, took out of her  apron what he supposed to be a handful of sand,  and laid it in a basin which stood upon a table by  his bedside. The little woman desired him to take  another handful, and he did once more as she bade  him. Thereupon the woman descended the ladder;  and the procession, weeping and lamenting, departed  from the chamber.
          When day broke, Hermann saw that the supposed  sand which he had taken from the apron of the  little woman was nothing less than pure and  beautiful grains of gold.
          But what happened? On that very day he lost  his Countess in childbirth, and his new-born son.  Hermann mourned her loss so bitterly that he was  very soon laid beside her in the grave. With him  perished the house of Rosenberg.
