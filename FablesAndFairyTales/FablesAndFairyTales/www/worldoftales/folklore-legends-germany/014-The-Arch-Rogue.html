          There once lived, years ago, a man known only by  the name of the Arch Rogue. By dint of skill in  the black art, and all arts of imposition, he drove a  more flourishing trade than all the rest of the sorcerers  of the age. It was his delight to travel from  one country to another merely to play upon mankind,  and no living soul was secure, either in house  or field, nor could properly call them his own.
          Now his great reputation for these speedy methods  of possessing himself of others' property excited the  envy of a certain king of a certain country, who  considered them as no less than an invasion of his  royal prerogative. He could not sleep a wink for  thinking about it, and he despatched troops of  soldiers, one after another, with strict orders to  arrest him, but all their search was in vain. At  length, after long meditation, the king said to himself&mdash;
          &quot;Only wait a little, thou villain cutpurse, and yet  I will have thee.&quot;
          Forthwith he issued a manifesto, stating that the  royal mercy would be extended to so light-fingered  a genius, upon condition that he consented to appear  at court and give specimens of his dexterity for his  majesty's amusement.
          One afternoon, as the king was standing at his  palace window enjoying the fine prospect of woods  and dales, over which a tempest appeared to be  then just gathering, some one suddenly clapped him  upon the shoulder, and on looking round he discovered  a very tall, stout, dark-whiskered man close  behind him, who said&mdash;
          &quot;Here I am.&quot;
          &quot;Who are you?&quot; inquired the king.
          &quot;He whom you look for.&quot;
          The king uttered an exclamation of surprise, not  unmixed with fear, at such amazing assurance. The  stranger continued, &quot;Don't be alarmed. Only keep  your word with me, and I will prove myself quite  obedient to your orders.&quot;
          This being agreed on, the king acquainted his  royal consort and the whole court that the great  sleight-of-hand genius had discovered himself, and  soon, in a full assembly, his majesty proceeded to  question him, and lay on him his commands.
          &quot;Mark what I say,&quot; he said, &quot;nor venture to dispute  my orders. To begin, do you see yon rustic,  not far from the wood, busy ploughing?&quot;
          The conjurer nodded assent.
          &quot;Then go,&quot; continued the king,&mdash;&quot;go and rob him  of his plough and oxen without his knowing anything  about it.&quot;
          The king flattered himself that this was impossible,  for he did not conceive how the conjurer  could perform such a task in the face of open day,&mdash;and  if he fail, thought he, I have him in my power,  and will make him smart.
          The conjurer proceeded to the spot, and as the  storm appeared to increase, the rain beginning to  pour down in torrents, the countryman, letting his  oxen rest, ran under a tree for shelter, until the  rain should have ceased. Just then he heard some  one singing in the wood. Such a glorious song he  had never heard before in all his life. He felt  wonderfully enlivened, and, as the weather continued  dull, he said to himself&mdash;
          &quot;Well, there's no harm in taking a look. Yes;  I'll see what sport is stirring,&quot; and away he slipped  into the wood, still further and further, in search of  the songster.
          In the meanwhile the conjurer was not idle. He  changed places with the rustic, taking care of the  oxen while their master went searching through the  wood. Darting out of the thicket, in a few moments  he had slashed off the oxen's horns and tails, and  stuck them, half hid, in the ploughman's last furrow.  He then drove off the beasts pretty sharply towards  the palace. In a short time the rustic found his  way back, and looking towards the spot for his  oxen could see nothing of them. Searching on all  sides, he came at last to examine the furrow, and  beheld, to his horror, the horns and tails of his poor  beasts sticking out of the ground. Imagining that  a thunderbolt must have struck the beasts, and the  earth swallowed them up, he poured forth a most  dismal lamentation over his lot, roaring aloud until  the woods echoed to the sound. When he was  tired of this, he bethought him of running home to  find a pick and a spade to dig his unlucky oxen out  of the earth as soon as possible.
          As he went he was met by the king and the conjurer,  who inquired the occasion of his piteous  lamentation.
          &quot;My oxen! my poor oxen!&quot; cried the boor, and  then he related all that had happened to him,  entreating them to go with him to the place. The  conjurer said&mdash;
          &quot;Why don't you see if you cannot pull the oxen  out again by the horns or by the tail?&quot;
          With this the rustic, running back, seized one of  the tails, and, pulling with all his might, it gave way  and he fell backward.
          &quot;Thou hast pulled thy beast's tail off,&quot; said the  conjurer. &quot;Try if thou canst succeed better with  his horns. If not, thou must even dig them out.&quot;
          Again the rustic tried with the same result, while  the king laughed very heartily at the sight. As the  worthy man now appeared excessively troubled at  his misfortunes, the king promised him another pair  of oxen, and the rustic was content.
          &quot;You have made good your boast,&quot; said the king  to the conjurer, as they returned to the palace; &quot;but  now you will have to deal with a more difficult  matter, so muster your wit and courage. To-night  you must steal my favourite charger out of his stable,  and let nobody know who does it.&quot;
          Now, thought the king, I have trapped him at  last, for he will never be able to outwit my master  of the horse, and all my grooms to boot. To make  the matter sure, he ordered a strong guard under  one of his most careful officers to be placed round  the stable court. They were armed with stout  battle-axes, and were enjoined every half-hour to  give the word, and pace alternately through the  court. In the royal stables others had the like duty  to perform, while the master of the horse himself  was to ride the favourite steed the whole time,  having been presented by the king with a gold snuff-box,  from which he was to take ample pinches in  order to keep himself awake, and give signal by a  loud sneeze. He was also armed with a heavy  sword, with which he was to knock the thief on the  head if he approached.
          The rogue first arrayed himself in the master of  the bedchamber's clothes, without his leave. About  midnight he proceeded to join the guards, furnished  with different kinds of wine, and told them that the  king had sent him to thank them for so cheerfully  complying with his orders. He also informed them  that the impostor had been already caught and  secured, and added that the king had given permission  for the guards to have a glass or two, and  requested that they would not give the word quite  so loudly, as her majesty had not been able to close  her eyes. He then marched into the stables, where  he found the master of the horse astride the royal  charger, busily taking snuff and sneezing at intervals.  The master of the bedchamber poured him out  a sparkling glass to drink to the health of his  majesty, who had sent it, and it looked too excellent  to resist. Both master and guards then began to  jest over the Arch Rogue's fate, taking, like good  subjects, repeated draughts&mdash;all to his majesty's  health. At length they began to experience their  effects. They gaped and stretched, sank gradually  upon the ground, and fell asleep. The master, by  dint of fresh pinches, was the last to yield, but he  too blinked, stopped the horse, which he had kept  at a walk, and said&mdash;
          &quot;I am so confoundedly sleepy I can hold it no  longer. Take you care of the charger for a moment.  Bind him fast to the stall&mdash;and just keep watch.&quot;
          Having uttered these words, he fell like a heavy  sack upon the floor and snored aloud. The conjurer  took his place upon the horse, gave it whip  and spur, and galloped away through the sleeping  guards, through the court gates, and whistled as he  went.
          Early in the morning the king, eager to learn the  result, hastened to his royal mews, and was not a little  surprised to find the whole of his guards fast asleep  upon the ground, but he saw nothing of his charger.
          &quot;What is to do here?&quot; he cried in a loud voice.  &quot;Get up; rouse, you idle varlets!&quot;
          At last one of them, opening his eyes, cried out&mdash;
          &quot;The king! the king!&quot;
          &quot;Ay, true enough, I am here,&quot; replied his  majesty, &quot;but my favourite horse is not. Speak,  answer on the instant.&quot;
          While the affrighted wretches, calling one to  another, rubbed their heavy eyes, the king was  examining the stalls once more, and, stumbling over  his master of the horse, turned and gave him some  hearty cuffs about the ears. But the master only  turned upon the other side, and grumbled&mdash;
          &quot;Let me alone, you rascal, my royal master's  horse is not for the like of you.&quot;
          &quot;Rascal!&quot; exclaimed the king, &quot;do you know who  it is?&quot; and he was just about to call his attendants,  when he heard hasty footsteps, and the conjurer  stood before him.
          &quot;My liege,&quot; he said, &quot;I have just returned from  an airing on your noble horse. He is, indeed, a fine  animal, but once or so I was obliged to give him the  switch.&quot;
           The king felt excessively vexed at the rogue's  success, but he was the more resolved to hit upon  something that should bring his fox skin into  jeopardy at last. So he thought, and the next day  he addressed the conjurer thus&mdash;
          &quot;Thy third trial is now about to take place, and  if you are clever enough to carry it through, you  shall not only have your life and liberty, but a  handsome allowance to boot. In the other case you  know your fate. Now listen. This very night I  command you to rob my queen consort of her bridal  ring, to steal it from her finger, and let no one know  the thief or the way of thieving.&quot;
          When night approached, his majesty caused all  the doors in the palace to be fast closed, and a  guard to be set at each. He himself, instead of  retiring to rest, took his station, well armed, in an  easy chair close to the queen's couch.
          It was a moonlight night, and about two in the  morning the king plainly heard a ladder reared up  against the window, and the soft step of a man  mounting it. When the king thought the conjurer  must have reached the top, he called out from the  window&mdash;
          &quot;Let fall.&quot;
          The next moment the ladder was dashed away,  and something fell with a terrible crash to the  ground. The king uttered an exclamation of alarm,  and ran down into the court, telling the queen, who  was half asleep, that he was going to see if the  conjurer were dead. But the rogue had borrowed  a dead body from the gallows, and having dressed  it in his own clothes, had placed it on the ladder.  Hardly had the king left the chamber before the  conjurer entered it and said to the queen in the  king's voice&mdash;
          &quot;Yes, he is stone dead, so you may now go  quietly to sleep, only hand me here your ring. It  is too costly and precious to trust it in bed while  you sleep.&quot;
          The queen, imagining it was her royal consort,  instantly gave him the ring, and in a moment the  conjurer was off with it on his finger. Directly  afterwards the king came back.
          &quot;At last,&quot; he said, &quot;I have indeed carried the  joke too far. I have repaid him. He is lying there  as dead as a door nail. He will plague us no  more.&quot;
          &quot;I know that already,&quot; replied the queen. &quot;You  have told me exactly the same thing twice over.&quot;
          &quot;How came you to know anything about it?&quot;  inquired his majesty.
          &quot;How? From yourself to be sure,&quot; replied his  consort. &quot;You informed me that the conjurer was  dead, and then you asked me for my ring.&quot;
          &quot;I ask for the ring!&quot; exclaimed the king. &quot;Then  I suppose you must have given it to him,&quot; continued  his majesty, in a tone of great indignation;  &quot;and is it even so at last? By all the saints, this  is one of the most confounded, unmanageable knaves  in existence. I never knew anything to equal it.&quot;
          Then he informed the queen of the whole affair,  though before he arrived at the conclusion of his  tale she was fast asleep.
          Soon after it was light in the morning the wily  conjurer made his appearance. He bowed to the  earth three times before the queen and presented  her with the treasure he had stolen. The king,  though excessively chagrined, could not forbear  laughing at the sight.
          &quot;Now hear,&quot; said he, &quot;thou king of arch rogues.  Had I only caught a sight of you through my  fingers as you were coming, you would never have  come off so well. As it is, let what is past be forgiven  and forgotten. Take up your residence at  my court, and take care that you do not carry your  jokes too far, for in such a case I may find myself  compelled to withdraw my favour from you if  nothing worse ensue.&quot;
