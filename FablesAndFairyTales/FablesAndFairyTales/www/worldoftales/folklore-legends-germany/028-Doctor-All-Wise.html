          There was a poor peasant, named Crab, who once  drove two oxen, with a load of wood, into the city,  and there sold it for two dollars to a doctor. The  doctor counted out the money to him as he sat at  dinner, and the peasant, seeing how well he fared,  yearned to live like him, and would needs be a  doctor too. He stood a little while in thought, and  at last asked if he could not become a doctor.
          &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;that may be easily  managed. In the first place you must purchase an  A, B, C book, only taking care that it is one that  has got in the front of it a picture of a cock crowing.  Then sell your cart and oxen, and buy with the  money clothes, and all the other things needful.  Thirdly, and lastly, have a sign painted with the  words, 'I am Doctor All-Wise,' and have it nailed  up before the door of your house.&quot;
          The peasant did exactly as he had been told; and  after he had doctored a little while, it chanced that  a certain nobleman was robbed of a large sum of  money. Some one told him that there lived in the  village hard by a Doctor All-Wise, who was sure to  be able to tell him where his money had gone. The  nobleman at once ordered his carriage to be got  ready and rode into the city, and having come to  the doctor, asked him if he was Dr. All-Wise.
          &quot;Oh yes,&quot; answered he, &quot;I am Doctor All-Wise,  sure enough.&quot;
          &quot;Will you go with me, then,&quot; said the nobleman,  &quot;and get me back my money?&quot;
          &quot;To be sure I will,&quot; said the doctor; &quot;but my  wife Grethel must go with me.&quot;
          The nobleman was pleased to hear this, made  them both get into the carriage with him, and away  they all rode together. When they arrived at the  nobleman's house dinner was already prepared, and  he desired the doctor to sit down with him.
          &quot;My wife Grethel, too,&quot; said the doctor.
          As soon as the first servant brought in the first  dish, which was some great delicacy, the doctor  nudged his wife, and said&mdash;
          &quot;Grethel, that is the first,&quot; meaning the first  dish.
          The servant overheard his remark, and thought  he meant to say he was the first thief, which was  actually the case, so he was sore troubled, and said  to his comrades&mdash;
          &quot;The doctor knows everything. Things will  certainly fall out ill, for he said I was the first  thief.&quot;
           The second servant would not believe what he  said, but at last he was obliged, for when he  carried the second dish into the room, the doctor  remarked to his wife&mdash;
          &quot;Grethel, that is the second.&quot;
          The second servant was now as much frightened  as the first, and was pleased to leave the apartment.  The third served no better, for the doctor said&mdash;
          &quot;Grethel, that is the third.&quot;
          Now the fourth carried in a dish which had a  cover on it, and the nobleman desired the doctor  to show his skill by guessing what was under the  cover. Now it was a crab. The doctor looked at  the dish, and then at the cover, and could not at  all divine what they contained, nor how to get out  of the scrape. At length he said, half to himself  and half aloud&mdash;
          &quot;Alas! poor crab!&quot;
          When the nobleman heard this, he cried out&mdash;
          &quot;You have guessed it, and now I am sure you  will know where my money is.&quot;
          The servant was greatly troubled at this, and he  winked to the doctor to follow him out of the  room, and no sooner did he do so than the whole  four who had stolen the gold stood before him,  and said that they would give it up instantly, and  give him a good sum to boot, provided he would  not betray them, for if he did their necks would pay  for it. The doctor promised, and they conducted  him to the place where the gold lay concealed. The  doctor was well pleased to see it, and went back to  the nobleman, and said&mdash;
          &quot;My lord, I will now search in my book and  discover where the money is.&quot;
          Now the fifth servant had crept into an oven to  hear what the doctor said. He sat for some time  turning over the leaves of his A, B, C book, looking  for the picture of the crowing cock, and as he did  not find it readily, he exclaimed&mdash;
          &quot;I know you are in here, and you must come  out.&quot;
          Then the man in the oven, thinking the doctor  spoke of him, jumped out in a great fright, saying&mdash;
          &quot;The man knows everything.&quot;
          Then Doctor All-Wise showed the nobleman  where the gold was hidden, but he said nothing as  to who stole it. So he received a great reward  from all parties, and became a very famous man.
