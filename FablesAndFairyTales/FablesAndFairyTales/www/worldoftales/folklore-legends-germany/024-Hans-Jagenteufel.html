          It is commonly believed that if any person  is guilty of a crime for which he deserves to  lose his head, he will, if he escape punishment  during his lifetime, be condemned after his  death to wander about with his head under his  arm.
          In the year 1644 a woman of Dresden went out  early one Sunday morning into a neighbouring  wood for the purpose of collecting acorns. In an  open space, at a spot not very far from the place  which is called the Lost Water, she heard somebody  blow a very strong blast upon a hunting-horn,  and immediately afterwards a heavy fall  succeeded, as though a large tree had fallen to the  ground. The woman was greatly alarmed, and  concealed her little bag of acorns among the  grass. Shortly afterwards the horn was blown a  second time, and on looking round she saw a man  without a head, dressed in a long grey cloak,  and riding upon a grey horse. He was booted  and spurred, and had a bugle-horn hanging at his  back.
          As he rode past her very quietly she regained  her courage, went on gathering the acorns, and  when evening came returned home undisturbed.
          Nine days afterwards, the woman returned to  that spot for the purpose of again collecting the  acorns, and as she sat down by the Forsterberg,  peeling an apple, she heard behind her a voice  calling out to her&mdash;
          &quot;Have you taken a whole sack of acorns and  nobody tried to punish you for doing so?&quot;
          &quot;No,&quot; said she. &quot;The foresters are very kind  to the poor, and they have done nothing to me&mdash;the  Lord have mercy on my sins!&quot;
          With these words she turned about, and there  stood he of the grey cloak, but this time he was  without his horse, and carried his head, which  was covered with curling brown hair, under his  arm.
          The woman shrank from him in alarm, but the  spirit said&mdash;
          &quot;Ye do well to pray to God to forgive you your  sins, it was never my good lot to do so.&quot;
          Thereupon he related to her how that he had  lived about one hundred and thirty years before,  and was called Hans Jagenteufel, as his father had  been before him, and how his father had often  besought him not to be too hard upon poor people,  how he had paid no regard to the advice his father  had given him, but had passed his time in drinking  and carousing, and in all manner of wickedness, for  which he was now condemned to wander about the  world as an evil spirit.
