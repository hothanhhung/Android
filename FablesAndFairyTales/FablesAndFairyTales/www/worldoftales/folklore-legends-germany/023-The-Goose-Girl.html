          The king of a great land died, and left his queen  to take care of their only child. This child was a  daughter, who was very beautiful, and her mother  loved her dearly and was very kind to her. When  she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived  a great way off; and as the time drew near for her  to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey  to his country. The queen, her mother, packed up  a great many costly things&mdash;jewels, gold and silver  trinkets, fine dresses, and, in short, everything that  became a royal bride. She gave her a waiting-maid  to ride with her and give her into the bridegroom's  hands, and each had a horse for the journey. The  princess' horse was called Falada, and could speak.
          When the time came for them to set out, the  aged mother went into the princess's bedchamber,  took a knife, and having cut her finger till it bled,  let three drops of the blood fall upon a handkerchief,  and gave it to the princess, saying&mdash;
          &quot;Take care of it, dear child, for it is a charm  that may be of use to you on the road.&quot;
           They all took a sorrowful leave of the princess,  and she put the handkerchief into her bosom, got  upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her  bridegroom's kingdom.
          One day as they were riding along by a brook,  the princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to  her maid&mdash;
          &quot;Pray get down, and fetch me some water in my  golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to  drink.&quot;
          &quot;Nay,&quot; said the maid, &quot;if you are thirsty, get off  yourself and stoop down by the water and drink.  I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.&quot;
          The princess got down, and knelt over the brook  and drank, for she was frightened, and dared not  bring out her cup; and she wept, and said&mdash;
          &quot;Alas! what will become of me?&quot;
          The three drops of blood answered her, and  said&mdash;
          
             &quot;Alas, alas! if thy mother knew it,  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.&quot; 
          
          The princess was very gentle and meek, so she  said nothing to her maid's ill-behaviour, but got  upon her horse again.
          They all rode further on their journey, till the  day grew so warm and the sun so scorching that  the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at  last, when they came to a river, she forgot her  maid's rude speech, and said&mdash;
          &quot;Pray get down, and fetch me some water to  drink in my cup.&quot;
          But the maid answered her, and even spoke more  haughtily than before&mdash;
          &quot;Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.&quot;
          Then the princess got off her horse, and lay down,  and held her head over the running stream, and  cried and said&mdash;
          &quot;What will become of me?&quot;
          And the drops of blood answered her again as  before. As the princess leaned down to drink, the  handkerchief on which was the blood fell from her  bosom and floated away on the water, but the  princess was so frightened that she did not notice  it. Her maid, however, saw it, and was very glad,  for she knew the charm, and she saw that the poor  bride would be in her power now that she had lost  the drops of blood. So when the bride had done  drinking, and would have got upon Falada again,  the maid said&mdash;
          &quot;I will ride upon Falada, and you may have my  horse instead;&quot; so the princess was forced to give  up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her  royal clothes and put on her maid's shabby ones.
          At last, as they drew near the end of their journey,  this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress  if she ever told any one what had happened;  but Falada saw it all, and marked it well.
           Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, while  the real bride rode upon the other horse, and  they went on in this way until they came at last to  the royal court. There was great joy at their  coming, and the prince flew to meet them, and  lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the  one who was to be his wife. She was led upstairs  to the royal chamber, but the true princess was told  to stay in the court below.
          Now the old king happened just then to have  nothing else to do, so he was amusing himself by  sitting at his window looking at what was going on,  and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked  very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he  went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who  it was she had brought with her that was thus left  standing in the court below.
          &quot;I brought her with me for the sake of her  company on the road,&quot; replied she. &quot;Pray give  the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle.&quot;
          The king could not for some time think of any  work for her to do, but at last he said&mdash;
          &quot;I have a lad who takes care of my geese, she  may go and help him.&quot;
          Now the name of this lad, whom the princess was  to help in watching the king's geese, was Conrad.
          The false bride said to the prince&mdash;
          &quot;Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness.&quot;
          &quot;That I will,&quot; said the prince.
          &quot;Then tell one of your knackers to cut off the  head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very  unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road.&quot;
          In reality she was very much afraid lest Falada  should some day or other speak, and tell all that  she had done to the princess. She carried her point,  and the faithful Falada was killed. When the true  princess heard of it she wept, and begged the man  to nail up Falada's head over a large dark gate of  the city, through which she had to pass every  morning and evening, that there she might see him  sometimes. The slaughterer said he would do as  she wished, and he cut off the head, and nailed it up  under the dark gate.
          Early the next morning, as the princess and  Conrad went through the gate, she said sorrowfully&mdash;
          
             &quot;Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!&quot; 
          
          The head answered&mdash;
          
             &quot;Bride, bride, there thou goest!  Alas, alas! if thy mother knew it,  Sadly, sadly would she rue it.&quot; 
          
          Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese  on. When they were come to a meadow she sat  down upon a bank there, and let down her waving  locks of hair, which were like pure gold; and when  Conrad saw it he ran up, and would have pulled  some of the locks out, but the princess cried&mdash;
          
            &quot;Blow, breezes, blow!  Let Conrad's hat go!  Blow, breezes, blow!  Let him after it go!  O'er hills, dales, and rocks,  Away be it whirled,  Till my golden locks  Are all combed and curled.&quot; 
          
          Then there came a wind so strong that it blew  off Conrad's hat. Away it flew over the hills, and  he was forced to turn and run after it, so that when  he came back she had done combing and curling her  hair, and had put it up again safely, and he could not  get any of it. He was very angry and sulky, and  would not speak to her; but they watched the geese  until it grew dark, and then drove them homewards.
          The next morning, as they were going through  the dark gate, the poor girl looked up at Falada's  head, and cried&mdash;
          
             &quot;Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!&quot; 
          
          It answered&mdash;
          
             &quot;Bride, bride, there thou goest!  Alas, alas! if thy mother knew it,  Sadly, sadly would she rue it.&quot; 
          
          Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again  in the meadow, and began to comb out her hair as  before, and Conrad ran up to her, and wanted to  take hold of it. The princess repeated the words  she had used the day before, when the wind came  and blew away his hat, and off it flew a great way,  over the hills and far away, so that he had to run  after it. When he returned, she had bound up her  hair again, and all was safe. So they watched the  geese until it grew dark.
          In the evening, after they came home, Conrad  went to the old king and said&mdash;
          &quot;I won't have that strange girl to help me to  keep the geese any longer.&quot;
          &quot;Why?&quot; said the king.
          &quot;Because instead of doing any good she does  nothing but tease me all day long.&quot;
          Then the king made him tell what had happened,  and Conrad said&mdash;
          &quot;When we go in the morning through the dark  gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with  the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and  the head answers her.&quot;
          And Conrad went on telling the king what had  happened in the meadow where the geese fed; how  his hat was blown away, and how he was forced to  run after it and leave his flock of geese to themselves.  The old king told the boy to go out again  the next day, and when morning came he placed  himself behind the dark gate, and heard how the  princess spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered.  Then he went into the field and hid himself in a  bush by the meadow's side, and he soon saw with  his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese, and  how, after a little time, she let down her hair that  glittered in the sun. Then he heard her call the  wind, and soon there came a gust that carried away  Conrad's hat, and away he went after it, while the  girl went on combing and curling her hair. All this  the old king saw; so he went home without having  been observed, and when the goose-girl came back in  the evening, he called her aside and asked her why  she did so. She burst into tears, and said&mdash;
          &quot;That I must not tell you nor any man, or I  shall lose my life.&quot;
          The old king begged hard, but she would tell him  nothing. Then he said&mdash;
          &quot;If you will not tell me thy story, tell thy grief  to the iron stove there,&quot; and then he went away.
          Then the princess crept into the stove, and, weeping  and lamenting, she poured forth her whole  heart, saying&mdash;
          &quot;I am alone in the whole world, though I am a  king's daughter. A treacherous waiting-maid has  taken my place and compelled me to put off my  royal dress, and even taken my place with my bridegroom,  while I have to work as a goose-girl. If  my mother knew it, it would break her heart.&quot;
          The old king, however, was standing by the stove,  listening to what the princess said, and overheard it  all. He ordered royal clothes to be put upon her,  and gazed at her in wonder, she was so beautiful.  Then he called his son, and told him that he had  only a false bride, for that she was merely the  waiting-maid, while the true bride stood by. The  young prince rejoiced when he saw the princess's  beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had  been, and the king ordered a great feast to be got  ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the  top of the table, with the false princess on one side  and the true one on the other; but the waiting-maid  did not recognise the princess, for her beauty was  quite dazzling.
          When they had eaten and drunk, and were very  merry, the old king said he would tell them a tale.  So he began, and told all the story of the princess,  as if it were a tale he had heard, and he asked the  waiting-woman what she thought ought to be done  to any one who behaved so badly as the servant in  the story.
          &quot;Nothing better,&quot; said the false bride, &quot;than that  she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with  sharp nails, and that two white horses should be  put to it, and should drag it from street to street  till she were dead.&quot;
          &quot;Thou art she,&quot; said the old king, &quot;and as thou  hast judged thyself, so it shall be done to thee.&quot;
          Then the young prince was married to his true  wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace  and happiness all their lives.
