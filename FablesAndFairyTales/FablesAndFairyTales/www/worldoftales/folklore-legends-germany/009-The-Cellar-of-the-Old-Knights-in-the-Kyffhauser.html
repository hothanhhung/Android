          There was a poor, but worthy, and withal very  merry, fellow at Tilleda, who was once put to the  expense of a christening, and, as luck would have  it, it was the eighth. According to the custom of  the time, he was obliged to give a plain feast to the  child's sponsors. The wine of the country which  he put before his guests was soon exhausted, and  they began to call for more.
          &quot;Go,&quot; said the merry father of the newly baptized  child to his eldest daughter, a handsome girl  of sixteen,&mdash;&quot;go, and get us better wine than this  out of the cellar.&quot;
          &quot;Out of what cellar?&quot;
          &quot;Why, out of the great wine-cellar of the old  Knights in the Kyffhauser, to be sure,&quot; said her  father jokingly.
          The simple-minded girl did as he told her, and  taking a small pitcher in her hand went to the  mountain. In the middle of the mountain she  found an aged housekeeper, dressed in a very  old-fashioned style, with a large bundle of keys at her  girdle, sitting at the ruined entrance of an immense  cellar. The girl was struck dumb with amazement,  but the old woman said very kindly&mdash;
          &quot;Of a surety you want to draw wine out of the  Knights' cellar?&quot;
          &quot;Yes,&quot; said the girl timidly, &quot;but I have no  money.&quot;
          &quot;Never mind that,&quot; said the old woman; &quot;come  with me, and you shall have wine for nothing, and  better wine too than your father ever tasted.&quot;
          So the two went together through the half-blocked-up  entrance, and as they went along the  old woman made the girl tell her how affairs were  going on at that time in Tilleda.
          &quot;For once,&quot; said she, &quot;when I was young, and  good-looking as you are, the Knights stole me away  in the night-time, and brought me through a hole  in the ground from the very house in Tilleda which  now belongs to your father. Shortly before that  they had carried away by force from Kelbra, in  broad daylight, the four beautiful damsels who  occasionally still ride about here on horses richly  caparisoned, and then disappear again. As for me,  as soon as I grew old, they made me their butler,  and I have been so ever since.&quot;
          They had now reached the cellar door, which the  old woman opened. It was a very large roomy  cellar, with barrels ranged along both sides. The  old woman rapped against the barrels&mdash;some were  quite full, some were only half full. She took the  little pitcher, drew it full of wine, and said&mdash;
          &quot;There, take that to your father, and as often as  you have a feast in your house you may come here  again; but, mind, tell nobody but your father  where you get the wine from. Mind, too, you must  never sell any of it&mdash;it costs nothing, and for  nothing you must give it away. Let any one but  come here for wine to make a profit off it and his  last bread is baked.&quot;
          The girl took the wine to her father, whose  guests were highly delighted with it, and sadly  puzzled to think where it came from, and ever  afterwards, when there was a little merry-making  in the house, would the girl fetch wine from the  Kyffhauser in her little pitcher. But this state of  things did not continue long. The neighbours  wondered where so poor a man contrived to get  such delicious wine that there was none like it in  the whole country round. The father said not a  word to any one, and neither did his daughter.
          Opposite to them, however, lived the publican  who sold adulterated wine. He had once tasted the  Old Knights' wine, and thought to himself that one  might mix it with ten times the quantity of water  and sell it for a good price after all. Accordingly,  when the girl went for the fourth time with her  little pitcher to the Kyffhauser, he crept after her,  and concealed himself among the bushes, where he  watched until he saw her come out of the entrance  which led to the cellar, with her pitcher filled with  wine.
          On the following evening he himself went to the  mountain, pushing before him in a wheelbarrow the  largest empty barrel he could procure. This he  thought of filling with the choicest wine in the  cellar, and in the night rolling it down the mountain,  and in this way he intended to come every  day, as long as there was any wine left in the  cellar.
          When, however, he came to the place where he  had the day before seen the entrance to the cellar,  it grew all of a sudden totally dark. The wind  began to howl fearfully, and a monster threw him,  his barrow, and empty butt, from one ridge of rocks  to another, and he kept falling lower and lower,  until at last he fell into a cemetery.
          There he saw before him a coffin covered with  black, and his wife and four of her gossips, whom  he knew well by their dress and figures, were  following a bier. His fright was so great that he  swooned away.
          After some hours he came to himself again, and  saw, to his horror, that he was still in the dimly  lighted vaults, and heard just above his head the  well-known town clock of Tilleda strike twelve, and  thereby he knew that it was midnight, and that he  was then under the church, in the burying-place of  the town. He was more dead than alive, and  scarcely dared to breathe.
          Presently there came a monk, who led him up a  long, long flight of steps, opened a door, placed,  without speaking, a piece of gold in his hand, and  deposited him at the foot of the mountain. It was  a cold frosty night. By degrees the publican  recovered himself, and crept, without barrel or  wine, back to his own home. The clock struck  one as he reached the door. He immediately took  to his bed, and in three days was a dead man, and  the piece of gold which the wizard monk had given  him was expended on his funeral.
