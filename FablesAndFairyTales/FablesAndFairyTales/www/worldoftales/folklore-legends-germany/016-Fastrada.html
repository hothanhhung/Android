          By the side of the &quot;Beautiful Doorway,&quot; leading  into the cloisters of the cathedral at Mainz, stands,  worked into the wall, a fragment of the tomb of  Fastrada, the fourth wife of the mighty monarch  Charlemagne according to some authorities, the  third according to others. Fastrada figures in the  following tradition related by the author of the  Rhyming Chronicle.
          When the Kaiser, Karl, abode at Zurich, he  dwelt in a house called &quot;The Hole,&quot; in front of  which he caused a pillar to be erected with a bell  on the top of it, to the end that whoever demanded  justice should have the means of announcing himself.  One day, as he sat at dinner in his house, he  heard the bell ring, and sent out his servants to  bring the claimant before him; but they could find  no one. A second and a third time the bell rang,  but no human being was still to be seen. At length  the Kaiser himself went forth, and he found a large  serpent, which had twined itself round the shaft of  the pillar, and was then in the very act of pulling  the bell rope.
          &quot;This is God's will,&quot; said the monarch. &quot;Let  the brute be brought before me. I may deny justice  to none of God's creatures&mdash;man or beast.&quot;
          The serpent was accordingly ushered into the  imperial presence; and the Kaiser spoke to it as he  would to one of his own kind, gravely asking what  it required. The reptile made a most courteous  reverence to Charlemagne, and signed in its dumb  way for him to follow. He did so accordingly,  accompanied by his court; and the creature led  them on to the water's edge, to the shores of the  lake, where it had its nest. Arrived there, the  Kaiser soon saw the cause of the serpent's seeking  him, for its nest, which was full of eggs, was occupied  by a hideous toad of monstrous proportions.
          &quot;Let the toad be flung into the fire,&quot; said the  monarch solemnly, &quot;and let the serpent have  possession of its nest restored to it.&quot;
          This sentence was carried at once into execution.  The toad was burnt, and the serpent placed in possession.  Charlemagne and his court then returned  to the palace.
          Three days afterwards, as the Kaiser again sat at  dinner, he was surprised at the appearance of the  serpent, which this time glided into the hall unnoticed  and unannounced.
          &quot;What does this mean?&quot; thought the king.
          The reptile approached the table, and raising  itself on its tail, dropped from its mouth, into an  empty plate which stood beside the monarch, a precious  diamond. Then, again abasing itself before  him, the crawling creature glided out of the hall as  it had entered, and was speedily lost to view. This  diamond the monarch caused to be set in a costly  chased ring of the richest gold; and he then presented  the trinket to his fair wife, the much-beloved  Fastrada.
          Now this stone had the virtue of attraction, and  whoso received it from another, so long as they  wore it, received also the intensest love of that individual.  It was thus with Fastrada, for no sooner  did she place the ring on her finger than the attachment  of Charlemagne, great before, no longer  knew any bounds. In fact his love was more like  madness than any sane passion. But though this  talisman had full power over love, it had no power  over death; and the mighty monarch was soon to  experience that nothing may avert the fiat of destiny.
          Charlemagne and his beloved bride returned to  Germany, and, at Ingelheim palace, Fastrada died.  The Kaiser was inconsolable. He would not listen  to the voice of friendship, and he sorrowed in silence  over the dead body of his once beautiful bride.  Even when decay had commenced, when the remains,  late so lovely, were now loathsome to look  on, he could not be induced to leave the corpse for  a moment, or to quit the chamber of death in which  it lay. The court were all astounded. They knew  not what to make of the matter. At length Turpin,  Archbishop of Rheims, approached the corpse, and  being made aware of the cause, by some supernatural  communication contrived to engage the  emperor's attention while he removed the charm.  The magic ring was found by him in the mouth of  the dead empress, concealed beneath her tongue.
          Immediately that the talisman was removed the  spell was broken, and Charlemagne now looked on  the putrid corpse with all the natural horror and  loathing of an ordinary man. He gave orders for  its immediate interment, which were at once carried  into execution, and he then departed from Ingelheim  for the forest of the Ardennes. Arrived at  Aix-la-Chapelle, he took up his abode in the ancient  castle of Frankenstein, close by that famous city.  The esteem, however, that he had felt for Fastrada  was now transferred to the possessor of the ring,  Archbishop Turpin; and the pious ecclesiastic was  so persecuted by the emperor's affection that he  finally cast the talisman into the lake which surrounds  the castle.
          An immediate transference of the royal liking  took place, and the monarch, thenceforth and for  ever after during his lifetime, loved Aix-la-Chapelle  as a man might love his wife. So much did he  become attached to it, that he directed that he  should be buried there; and there accordingly his  remains rest unto this day.
