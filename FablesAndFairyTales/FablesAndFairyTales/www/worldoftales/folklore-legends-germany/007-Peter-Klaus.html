          Peter Klaus, a goatherd of Sittendorf, who tended  herds on the Kyffhauser mountain, used to let them  rest of an evening in a spot surrounded by an old  wall, where he always counted them to see if they  were all right. For some days he noticed that one  of his finest goats, as they came to this spot,  vanished, and never returned to the herd till late.  He watched him more closely, and at length saw  him slip through a rent in the wall. He followed  him, and caught him in a cave, feeding sumptuously  upon the grains of oats which fell one by one from  the roof. He looked up, shook his head at the  shower of oats, but, with all his care, could discover  nothing further. At length he heard overhead the  neighing and stamping of some mettlesome horses,  and concluded that the oats must have fallen from  their mangers.
          While the goatherd stood there, wondering about  these horses in a totally uninhabited mountain, a  lad came and made signs to him to follow him  silently. Peter ascended some steps, and, crossing  a walled court, came to a glade surrounded by rocky  cliffs, into which a sort of twilight made its way  through the thick-leaved branches. Here he found  twelve grave old knights playing at skittles, at a  well-levelled and fresh plot of grass. Peter was  silently appointed to set up the ninepins for them.
          At first his knees knocked together as he did  this, while he marked, with half-stolen glances, the  long beards and goodly paunches of the noble  knights. By degrees, however, he grew more confident,  and looked at everything about him with a  steady gaze&mdash;nay, at last, he ventured so far as to  take a draught from a pitcher which stood near  him, the fragrance of which appeared to him delightful.  He felt quite revived by the draught, and  as often as he felt at all tired, received new strength  from application to the inexhaustible pitcher. But  at length sleep overcame him.
          When he awoke, he found himself once more in  the enclosed green space, where he was accustomed  to leave his goats. He rubbed his eyes, but could  discover neither dog nor goats, and stared with surprise  at the height to which the grass had grown,  and at the bushes and trees, which he never remembered  to have noticed. Shaking his head, he proceeded  along the roads and paths which he was  accustomed to traverse daily with his herd, but  could nowhere see any traces of his goats. Below  him he saw Sittendorf; and at last he descended  with quickened step, there to make inquiries after  his herd.
          The people whom he met at his entrance to the  town were unknown to him, and dressed and  spoke differently from those whom he had known  there. Moreover, they all stared at him when he  inquired about his goats, and began stroking their  chins. At last, almost involuntarily, he did the  same, and found to his great astonishment that his  beard had grown to be a foot long. He began now  to think himself and the world altogether bewitched,  and yet he felt sure that the mountain from which  he had descended was the Kyffhauser; and the  houses here, with their fore-courts, were all familiar  to him. Moreover, several lads whom he heard  telling the name of the place to a traveller called it  Sittendorf.
          Shaking his head, he proceeded into the town  straight to his own house. He found it sadly fallen  to decay. Before it lay a strange herd-boy in  tattered garments, and near him an old worn-out  dog, which growled and showed his teeth at Peter  when he called him. He entered by the opening,  which had formerly been closed by a door, but  found all within so desolate and empty that he  staggered out again like a drunkard, and called his  wife and children. No one heard; no voice answered  him.
          Women and children now began to surround the  strange old man, with the long hoary beard, and to  contend with one another in inquiring of him what  he wanted. He thought it so ridiculous to make  inquiries of strangers, before his own house, after  his wife and children, and still more so, after himself,  that he mentioned the first neighbour whose  name occurred to him, Kirt Stiffen. All were silent,  and looked at one another, till an old woman said&mdash;
          &quot;He has left here these twelve years. He lives  at Sachsenberg; you'll hardly get there to-day.&quot;
          &quot;Velten Maier?&quot;
          &quot;God help him!&quot; said an old crone leaning on a  crutch. &quot;He has been confined these fifteen years  in the house, which he'll never leave again.&quot;
          He recognised, as he thought, his suddenly aged  neighbour; but he had lost all desire of asking any  more questions. At last a brisk young woman, with  a boy of a twelvemonth old in her arms, and with a  little girl holding her hand, made her way through  the gaping crowd, and they looked for all the  world like his wife and children.
          &quot;What is your name?&quot; said Peter, astonished.
          &quot;Maria.&quot;
          &quot;And your father?&quot;
          &quot;God have mercy on him, Peter Klaus. It is  twenty years since we sought him day and night on  the Kyffhauser, when his goats came home without  him. I was only seven years old when it happened.&quot;
           The goatherd could no longer contain himself.
          &quot;I am Peter Klaus,&quot; he cried, &quot;and no other,&quot;  and he took the babe from his daughter's arms.
          All stood like statues for a minute, till one and  then another began to cry&mdash;
          &quot;Here's Peter Klaus come back again! Welcome,  neighbour, welcome, after twenty years; welcome,  Peter Klaus!&quot;
