          Upon a high mountain in the Tyrol there stands an  old castle, in which there burns a fire every night,  and the flashes of that fire are so large that they rise  up over the walls, and may be seen far and wide.
          It happened once that an old woman in want of  firewood was gathering the fallen twigs and branches  upon this castle-crowned mountain, and at length  arrived at the castle door. To indulge her curiosity  she began peering about her, and at last entered, not  without difficulty, for it was all in ruins and not easily  accessible. When she reached the courtyard, there  she beheld a goodly company of nobles and ladies  seated and feasting at a huge table. There were,  likewise, plenty of servants, who waited upon them,  changing their plates, handing round the viands, and  pouring out wine for the party.
          As she thus stood gazing upon them, there came  one of the servants, who drew her on one side, and  placed a piece of gold in the pocket of her apron,  upon which the whole scene vanished in an instant,  and the poor frightened old woman was left to find  her way back as well as she could. However, she  got outside the courtyard, and there stood before  her a soldier with a lighted match, whose head was  not placed upon his neck, but held by him under his  arm. He immediately addressed the old woman,  and commanded her not to tell any one what she  had seen and heard upon peril of evil befalling her.
          At length the woman reached home, full of  anguish, still keeping possession of the gold, but  telling no one whence she had obtained it. When  the magistrates, however, got wind of the affair, she  was summoned before them, but she would not speak  one word upon the subject, excusing herself by saying  that if she uttered one word respecting it great  evil would ensue to her. When, however, they  pressed her more strictly, she discovered to them all  that had happened to her in the Fiery Castle, even  to the smallest particular. In an instant, almost  before her relation was fully ended, she was carried  away, and no one could ever learn whither she fled.
          A year or two afterwards, a young nobleman, a  knight, and one well experienced in all things, took  up his abode in those parts. In order that he might  ascertain the issue of this affair, he set out on foot  with his servant in the middle of the night on the  road to the mountain. With great difficulty they  made the ascent, and were on their way warned six  times by an unknown voice to desist from their  attempt.
           They kept on, however, heedless of this caution,  and at length reached the door of the castle. There  again stood the soldier as a sentinel, and he called  out as usual&mdash;
          &quot;Who goes there?&quot;
          The nobleman, who was bold of heart, gave for  answer&mdash;
          &quot;It is I.&quot;
          Upon this the spirit inquired further&mdash;
          &quot;Who art thou?&quot;
          This time the nobleman made no answer, but  desired his servant to hand him his sword. When  this was done, a black horseman came riding out of  the castle, against whom the nobleman would have  waged battle. The horseman, however, dragged  him up upon his horse and rode with him into the  courtyard, while the soldier chased the servant down  the mountain. The nobleman was never more seen.
