          The Sabbath-day drew to a close in the summer-tide  of the year of grace one thousand and one, and  the rustics of Ramersdorf amused themselves with a  dance, as was their wont to do, in the courtyard of  the monastery. It was a privilege that they had  enjoyed time immemorial, and it had never been  gainsaid by the abbots who were dead and gone,  but Anselm von Lowenberg, the then superior of the  convent, an austere, ascetic man, who looked with  disdain and dislike on all popular recreations, had  long set his face against it, and had, moreover, tried  every means short of actual prohibition to put an  end to the profane amusement. The rustics, however,  were not to be debarred by his displeasure  from pursuing, perhaps, their only pleasure; and  though the pious abbot discountenanced their proceedings,  they acquiesced not in his views, and their  enjoyment was not one atom the less.
          The day had been very beautiful, and the evening  was, if possible, more so. Gaily garbed maidens of  the village and stalwart rustics filled the courtyard  of the convent. A blind fiddler, who had fiddled  three generations off the stage, sat in front of a  group of elders of either sex, who, though too old  and too stiff to partake in the active and exciting  amusement, were still young enough to enjoy looking  on. A few shaven crowns peered from the latticed  casements which looked out on to the merry scene.  The music struck up, the dance began. Who  approaches? Why are so many anxious glances  cast in yonder direction? It is the Abbot.
          &quot;Cease your fooling,&quot; he spake to them, in a  solemn tone; &quot;profane not the place nor the day  with your idle mirth. Go home, and pray in your  own homes for the grace of the Lord to govern ye,  for ye are wicked and wilful and hard of heart as  the stones!&quot;
          He waved his hand as if to disperse them, but  his words and his action were equally unheeded by  the dancers and the spectators.
          &quot;Forth, vile sinners!&quot; he pursued. &quot;Forth  from these walls, or I will curse ye with the curse.&quot;
          Still they regarded him not to obey his behest,  although they so far noticed his words as to return  menacing look for look, and muttered threats for  threat with him. The music played on with the  same liveliness, the dancers danced as merrily as  ever, and the spectators applauded each display of  agility.
          &quot;Well, then,&quot; spake the Abbot, bursting with  rage, &quot;an ye cease not, be my curse on your head&mdash;there  may ye dance for a year and a day!&quot;
          He banned them bitterly; with uplifted hands  and eyes he imprecated the vengeance of Heaven on  their disobedience. He prayed to the Lord to punish  them for the slight of his directions. Then he  sought his cell to vent his ire in solitude.
          From that hour they continued to dance until a  year and a day had fully expired. Night fell, and  they ceased not; day dawned, and they danced still.  In the heat of noon, in the cool of the evening, day  after day there was no rest for them, their saltation  was without end. The seasons rolled over them.  Summer gave place to autumn, winter succeeded  summer, and spring decked the fields with early  flowers, as winter slowly disappeared, yet still they  danced on, through coursing time and changing  seasons, with unabated strength and unimpaired  energy. Rain nor hail, snow nor storm, sunshine  nor shade, seemed to affect them. Round and  round and round they danced, in heat and cold, in  damp and dry, in light and darkness. What were  the seasons&mdash;what the times or the hour or the  weather to them? In vain did their neighbours  and friends try to arrest them in their wild evolutions;  in vain were attempts made to stop them in  their whirling career; in vain did even the Abbot  himself interpose to relieve them from the curse  he had laid on them, and to put a period to the  punishment of which he had been the cause. The  strongest man in the vicinity held out his hand and  caught one of them, with the intention of arresting  his rotation, and tearing him from the charmed  circle, but his arm was torn from him in the attempt,  and clung to the dancer with the grip of life till  his day was done. The man paid his life as the  forfeit of his temerity. No effort was left untried  to relieve the dancers, but every one failed. The  sufferers themselves, however, appeared quite unconscious  of what was passing. They seemed to be  in a state of perfect somnambulism, and to be altogether  unaware of the presence of any persons, as  well as insensible to pain or fatigue. When the  expiration of their punishment arrived, they were  all found huddled together in the deep cavity which  their increasing gyrations had worn in the earth  beneath them. It was a considerable time before  sense and consciousness returned to them, and  indeed they never after could be said to enjoy them  completely, for, though they lived long, they were  little better than idiots during the remainder of their  lives.
