          To the traveller who has traversed the delightful  environs of the Rhine, from the city of Mentz as far  as Coblentz, or from the clear waves of this old  Germanic stream gazed upon the grand creations of  Nature, all upon so magnificent a scale, the appearance  of the old decayed tower which forms the  subject of the ensuing tradition forms no uninteresting  object. It rises before him as he mounts the  Rhine from the little island below Bingen, toward  the left shore. He listens to the old shipmaster as  he relates with earnest tone the wonderful story of  the tower, and, shuddering at the description of the  frightful punishment of priestly pride and cruelty,  exclaims in strong emotion&mdash;
          &quot;The Lord be with us!&quot;
          For, as the saying runs, it was about the year of  Our Lord 968, when Hatto II., Duke of the Ostro-franks,  surnamed Bonosus, Abbot of Fulda, a man  of singular skill and great spiritual endowments,  was elected Archbishop of Mentz. He was also a  harsh man, and being extremely avaricious, heaped  up treasure which he guarded with the utmost  care.
          It so happened, under his spiritual sway, that a  cruel famine began to prevail in the city of Mentz  and its adjacent parts, insomuch that in a short  time numbers of the poorer people fell victims to  utter want. Crowds of wretches were to be seen  assembled before the Archbishop's palace in the act  of beseeching with cries and prayers for some mitigation  of their heavy lot.
          But their harsh lord refused to afford relief out  of his own substance, reproaching them at the same  time as the authors of their own calamity by their  indolence and want of economy. But the poor  souls were mad for food, and in frightful and  threatening accents cried out&mdash;
          &quot;Bread, bread!&quot;
          Fearing the result, Bishop Hatto ordered a vast  number of hungry souls to range themselves in order  in one of his empty barns under the pretence of  supplying them with provisions. Then, having  closed the doors, he commanded his minions to fire  the place, in which all fell victims to the flames.  When he heard the death shouts and shrieks of the  unhappy poor, turning towards the menial parasites  who abetted his crime he said&mdash;
          &quot;Hark you! how the mice squeak!&quot;
          But Heaven that witnessed the deed did not  permit its vengeance to sleep. A strange and unheard  of death was preparing to loose its terrors upon  the sacrilegious prelate. For behold, there arose out  of the yet warm ashes of the dead an innumerable  throng of mice which were seen to approach the  Bishop, and to follow him whithersoever he went.  At length he flew into one of his steepest and  highest towers, but the mice climbed over the walls.  He closed every door and window, yet after him  they came, piercing their way through the smallest  nooks and crannies of the building. They poured  in upon him, and covered him from head to foot, in  numberless heaps. They bit, they scratched, they  tortured his flesh, till they nearly devoured him.  So great was the throng that the more his domestics  sought to beat them off, the more keen and savagely,  with increased numbers, did they return to the  charge. Even where his name was found placed  upon the walls and tapestries they gnawed it in  their rage away.
          In this frightful predicament the Bishop, finding  that he could obtain no help on land, bethought of  taking himself to the water. A tower was hastily  erected upon the Rhine. He took ship and shut  himself up there. Enclosed within double walls,  and surrounded by water, he flattered himself that  the rushing stream would effectually check the rage  of his enemies. Here too, however, the vengeance  of offended Heaven gave them entrance. Myriads  of mice took to the stream, and swam and swam,  and though myriads of them were swept away, an  innumerable throng still reached the spot. Again  they climbed and clattered up the walls. The  Bishop heard their approach. It was his last retreat.  They rushed in upon him with more irresistible  fury than before, and, amidst stifled cries of protracted  suffering, Bishop Hatto at length rendered  up his cruel and avaricious soul.
