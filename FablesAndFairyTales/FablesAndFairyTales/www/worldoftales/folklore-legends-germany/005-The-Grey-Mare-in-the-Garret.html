          In the portal of the Church of the Apostles, near  the new market in Cologne, hung a picture, the  portraits of a certain Frau Richmodis von Aducht  and her two children, of whom the following singular  story is related. The picture was covered with  a curtain which she worked with her own hands.
          Her husband, Richmuth von Aducht, was, in the  year of grace 1400, a rich burgomaster of Cologne,  and lived at the sign of the Parroquet in the New  Marckt. In that year a fearful plague desolated all  quarters of the city. She fell sick of the pest, and,  to all appearance, died. After the usual period had  elapsed she was buried in the vaults of the Apostles'  Church. She was buried, as the custom then was,  with her jewelled rings on her fingers, and most of  her rich ornaments on her person. These tempted  the cupidity of the sexton of the church. He  argued with himself that they were no use to the  corpse, and he determined to possess them. Accordingly  he proceeded in the dead of night to the vault  where she lay interred, and commenced the work  of sacrilegious spoliation. He first unscrewed the  coffin lid. He then removed it altogether, and proceeded  to tear away the shroud which interposed  between him and his prey. But what was his  horror to perceive the corpse clasp her hands slowly  together, then rise, and finally sit erect in the coffin.  He was rooted to the earth. The corpse made as  though it would step from its narrow bed, and the  sexton fled, shrieking, through the vaults. The  corpse followed, its long white shroud floating like  a meteor in the dim light of the lamp, which, in his  haste, he had forgotten. It was not until he reached  his own door that he had sufficient courage to look  behind him, and then, when he perceived no trace of  his pursuer, the excitement which had sustained  him so far subsided, and he sank senseless to the  earth.
          In the meantime Richmuth von Aducht, who had  slept scarcely a moment since the death of his dear  wife, was surprised by the voice of his old manservant,  who rapped loudly at his chamber door,  and told him to awake and come forth, for his  mistress had arisen from the dead, and was then at  the gate of the courtyard.
          &quot;Bah!&quot; said he, rather pettishly, &quot;go thy ways,  Hans; you dream, or are mad, or drunk. What you  see is quite impossible. I should as soon believe  my old grey mare had got into the garret as that  my wife was at the courtyard gate.&quot;
           Trot, trot, trot, trot, suddenly resounded high  over his head.
          &quot;What's that?&quot; asked he of his servant.
          &quot;I know not,&quot; replied the man, &quot;an' it be not  your old grey mare in the garret.&quot;
          They descended in haste to the courtyard, and  looked up to the window of the attic. Lo and behold!  there was indeed the grey mare with her head  poked out of the window, gazing down with her  great eyes on her master and his man, and seeming  to enjoy very much her exalted station, and their  surprise at it.
          Knock, knock, knock went the rapper of the  street gate.
          &quot;It is my wife!&quot; &quot;It is my mistress!&quot; exclaimed  master and man in the same breath.
          The door was quickly unfastened, and there,  truly, stood the mistress of the mansion, enveloped  in her shroud.
          &quot;Are you alive or dead?&quot; exclaimed the astonished  husband.
          &quot;Alive, my dear, but very cold,&quot; she murmured  faintly, her teeth chattering the while, as those of  one in a fever chill; &quot;help me to my chamber.&quot;
          He caught her in his arms and covered her with  kisses. Then he bore her to her chamber, and  called up the whole house to welcome and assist  her. She suffered a little from fatigue and fright,  but in a few days was very much recovered.
           The thing became the talk of the town, and  hundreds flocked daily to see, not alone the lady  that was rescued from the grave in so remarkable a  manner, but also the grey mare which had so  strangely contrived to get into the garret.
          The excellent lady lived long and happily with  her husband, and at her death was laid once more  in her old resting-place. The grey mare, after resting  in the garret three days, was got down by means  of scaffolding, safe and sound. She survived her  mistress for some time, and was a general favourite  in the city, and when she died her skin was stuffed,  and placed in the arsenal as a curiosity. The sexton  went mad with the fright he had sustained, and  in a short time entered that bourn whence he  had so unintentionally recovered the burgomaster's  wife.
          Not only was this memorable circumstance commemorated  in the Church of the Apostles, but it  was also celebrated in bassi relievi figures on the  walls of the burgomaster's residence&mdash;the sign of  the Parroquet in the New Marckt. The searcher  after antiquities will, however, look in vain for  either. They are not now to be found. Modern  taste has defaced the porch where stood the one,  and erected a shapeless structure on the site of the  other.
