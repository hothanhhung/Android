          The Convent of Schwartz-Rheindorf was founded  in the year of our Lord 1152 by the Bishop of  Cologne, Arnold Graf von Wied, for the reception of  noble ladies alone, and was placed by him under the  strict rule of St. Benedict. The prelate, who died  in the year 1159, lies buried beneath the high altar  of the church.
          Among the many other rights and privileges conferred  on the convent by the Bishop was the right  of fishing in the river, within certain limits above  and below the convent's territorial boundaries. This  was a most valuable right for a long period.
          The certainty of a profitable fishing was always  heralded by the appearance of two immense sturgeon.  They came at the commencement of each year, harbingers  of good luck, and they were ever succeeded  by shoals of river fish, in such numbers as to be  absolutely inexhaustible until the expiration of the  season. Of these sturgeon the one, a huge male,  always allowed himself to be taken by the fishermen,  but the female was never captured. It was understood  by those who knew all about these matters  that on her freedom depended the fisher's success.  This good fortune lasted for centuries.
          It was, however, remarked that as the discipline  of the convent became more and more relaxed, and  grace grew to be less and less among its inmates, the  fishing became more and more unprofitable. The  sturgeon, it is true, still made their appearance,  but they were spent and thin, and altogether unlike  those which had been wont of yore to visit the  fishing-ground of the sisterhood. The abbess and  the nuns, however, either could not or they would  not perceive the cause of the falling off in the take,  or the change in the appearance of the sturgeon, but  the common people who dwelt in the vicinity of the  convent, and especially those poor persons to whom  the river had been heretofore a source of support,  were neither slow in seeing the cause nor in publishing  the consequences to the world. Thus stood  matters: dissoluteness of life on the one hand, distress  on the other; profligacy and poverty, extravagance  and starvation, linked inseparably together.
          It was midwinter. On the bank of the river  stood the purveyor of the convent, accompanied by  the lady abbess herself and a great number of the nuns.  They waited to watch the first haul made by the  fishermen on the New Year's morning, according to  the custom which had prevailed in the convent for  centuries. It was not usual for the river to be open  at that time, but this year there was not a piece of  ice on its surface. The fishermen put out in their  boats, and cast their nets into the current; then,  making the circuit of the spot, they returned to the  bank and commenced to haul them in. Little  difficulty was at first experienced by them in this  operation. For several years preceding the supply  of fish had scarcely sufficed to defray the expense of  catching. It would seem, however, as if fortune  were inclined to smile on the sisterhood once more.  The nets had not been more than half drawn in  when the fishermen began to perceive that they contained  something heavier than usual. The lady  abbess and the nuns were made acquainted with the  circumstance, and they watched, in eager expectancy,  the landing of the fish. The nets were at length  with much trouble hauled on shore.
          &quot;Hilloa!&quot; said the principal fisherman, an aged  man, to the purveyor of the convent, &quot;hast thou  ever seen such monsters before? My soul! but this  will glad the hearts of the whole convent, and make  many poor folk happy, an it be but the harbinger of  a return to the old times.&quot;
          While he spoke two immense sturgeon were  landed. The abbess and her train approached the  landing-place, and admired the strength and superior  size of the fish.
          &quot;It would be but folly to set one of them free,&quot;  she partially soliloquised and partially spoke to the  purveyor. &quot;The convent has not had such a treat  for years past, and we absolutely require some  change. I'll warrant me they will eat delightfully.&quot;
          The purveyor, a wily Jewish-looking fellow, who  passed for an Italian, at once assented to the observations  of his mistress, and added a few remarks of his  own in support of them. Not so, however, the old  fisherman, who overheard the conversation, having  approached the abbess with the purveyor to learn  her will and pleasure as to the disposal of the fish.
          &quot;Nay, nay, master,&quot; he interposed, in his rough  way, &quot;not so fast, not so fast. My father fished on  this river for full fifty years, and my father's father  did the same; and fifty years have I drawn net  here too, all in the service of the noble ladies of  Schwartz-Rheindorf. Never, in that time, knew I  other than this done with these fish&mdash;the one to be  let free, the other to be given away among the poor.  I'll do nought else with them.&quot;
          The abbess and the purveyor were but ill-pleased  to hear what the old man said.
          &quot;You must do as I bid you, Herman,&quot; said the  former.
          &quot;You must obey my lady, your mistress,&quot; echoed  the latter. &quot;She is too good and gracious to ye.&quot;
          &quot;Not I,&quot; said the old man bluntly,&mdash;&quot;not I. For  all the broad lands on the Rhine I would not have  hand, act, nor part in such a matter. Do as ye list,  but I'll be none your servant in the matter.&quot;
           The old man walked away as he said these words,  and neither the entreaties of the abbess, the threats  of the purveyor, nor the interposition of some of the  nuns present could bring him back.
          Others, however, were soon found among his companions  who were less scrupulous; and the two  fish were accordingly removed to the convent, and  consigned to the care of the cook, to be served up  for dinner that day.
          The dinner-hour arrived&mdash;the sisterhood were all  seated at table&mdash;the servitors, marshalled by the  supple purveyor, made their appearance, bearing the  expected banquet in large covered dishes. A hasty  grace was muttered, and then every eye was turned  to the covers. The abbess had ordered the sturgeon  to be served up first.
          &quot;And now, sisters,&quot; she said, with a complacent  look of benignant condescension, &quot;I hope soon to  know how you approve of our dinner. It is my  constant study to make you happy, and my efforts  are unceasing to afford you every gratification in  my power. Let us begin.&quot;
          The covers were removed in a twinkling by the  servitors, the carvers clattered their knives and  forks impatiently; but what was the surprise of all,  when every dish as it was uncovered was found to  be empty. The wrath of the abbess rose at the  sight, and the zeal of the nuns knew no bounds in  seconding her indignation. The cook was hurriedly  sent for. He stood before the excited sisterhood  an abject, trembling wretch, far more like one who  expected to be made a victim of himself, than one  who would voluntarily make victims of others.
          &quot;How is this, villain?&quot; exclaimed the abbess,  her face reddening with rage.
          &quot;How's this, villain?&quot; echoed threescore female  voices, some of them not musical.
          &quot;Ay, how is this, hound?&quot; growled the purveyor.
          &quot;Do you mock us?&quot; continued the abbess, as the  cook stood trembling and silent.
          &quot;Do you mock us?&quot; echoed the purveyor, with  as much dignity as he could impart into his thin,  meagre figure.
          &quot;Speak!&quot; said the abbess in a loud voice, while  the cook cast his eyes around as if seeking aid  against the excited throng the room contained,&mdash;&quot;speak!&quot;
          Thus urged, the cook proceeded to explain&mdash;as far,  at least, as he was able. He declared that he had  cut up and cooked the sturgeon, according to the  directions he had received from the purveyor, and  that, when dinner was served up, he had sent  them up dressed in the manner that official had  directed.
          The abbess and her nuns were much puzzled how  to explain this extraordinary occurrence, and each  busied herself in conjectures which, as usual in such  cases, never approached the fact. At this juncture  the aged fisherman entered the room.
          &quot;My lady,&quot; he said to the abbess, when he learnt  what had occurred, &quot;it is the judgment of Heaven.  Even now I saw the fish in the river. I knew them  well, and I'll swear to them if necessary. They  floated away, swimming down the stream, and I am  a much mistaken man if ever ye see them any  more.&quot;
          The pleasurable anticipations of the day that the  sisters had entertained were completely annihilated;  but it would have been well for them if the consequences  of their avarice and gluttony had ended  with that hour. Never more did the sturgeon make  their appearance, and the part of the stream which  pertained to the convent thenceforth ceased to produce  fish of any kind whatsoever.
          People say that the Reformation had the effect of  wooing the finny tribe back to their old haunts. At  all events, whatever may have been the cause, it is  the fact that there is not at present a less plentiful  supply in this spot than there is in any other part  of that rich river.
