          PREFATORY NOTE
          It is proposed that this shall be the first of a  series of little volumes in which shall be presented  in a handy form selections from the  Folk-lore and legends of various countries. It  has been well said that &quot;the legendary history  of a nation is the recital of the elements that  formed the character of that nation; it contains  the first rude attempts to explain natural  phenomena, the traditions of its early history,  and the moral principles popularly adopted as  the rules for reward and punishment; and  generally the legends of a people may be  regarded as embodying the popular habits of  thought and popular motives of action.&quot; The  following legends of Germany cannot, we think,  fail to interest those who read them. Some of  the stories are invested with a charming simplicity  of thought which cannot but excite admiration.  Others are of a weird, fantastic  character fitted to a land of romantic natural  features, of broad river, mountain, and deep  forest. The humorous, the pathetic, the terrible,  all find place in the German folk-tales, and it  would be difficult to rise from their perusal  without having received both amusement and  instruction. The general lesson they convey is  the sure punishment of vice and the reward  of virtue; some way or another the villain  always meets with his desert. In future volumes  we shall deal with the legends of other countries,  hoping that the public will bear us company  in our excursions.
          INTRODUCTION
          The value of national stories and legends has in  late years become very widely recognised. Folk-lore  has recently received a large amount of attention,  and the thought and labour bestowed upon  the subject have been rewarded by results which  prove that its investigators have entered upon no  unfruitful, however long neglected, field.
          This book, and its successors in the series which  it is proposed to issue, may come into the hands of  some who, having little opportunity afforded them  to consider how the legends and tales it contains  may be of the value we claim for them, may be  glad to have the &quot;case&quot; for legends and national  stories presented to them in a few words.
          The peasant's tale, the story preserved through  centuries on the lips of old wives, the narrative  which has come down to us having done duty as a  source of amusement in the fireside groups of  preceding generations, may seem to some to afford  slight matter for reflection, and may even appear  so grotesque in its incidents as to be fitted only to  excite a smile of wonder at the simplicity of those  among whom such stories could obtain reception,  and surprise at the fantastic imagination in which  such tales could find their origin. Modern thought  has, however, been busy asking itself what is the  meaning of these stories, and it has done much to  supply itself with an answer. This, at least, it has  done: it has discovered that these legends and tales,  which so many have been inclined to cast aside as  worthless, are of a singular value, as throwing a  light which little else can afford upon the mind of  primitive man. At first the collection of national  stories was undertaken merely for the purpose of  affording amusement. Folk-tales were diverting, so  they found their way into print, and were issued  as curious literary matter fitted to supply diversion  for a vacant hour. Many of the tales are very  beautiful, and their mere literary merit sufficed to  make them sought for. But legendary lore was  soon observed to possess much more value than  could attach to its merely amusing features. It  was obvious that in these legends were preserved  the fragments of the beliefs of the ancient folk.  &quot;The mythology of one period,&quot; remarked Sir  Walter Scott, &quot;would appear to pass into the  romance of the next century, and that into the  nursery tale of the subsequent ages.&quot; &quot;Fiction,&quot;  said Sir John Malcolm, &quot;resolves itself into its  primitive elements, as, by the slow and unceasing  action of the wind and rain, the solid granite is  crumbled into sand. The creations embodied by  the vivid imagination of man in the childhood of  his race incorporate themselves in his fond and  mistaken faith. Sanctity is given to his daydreams  by the altar of the idol. Then, perhaps,  they acquire a deceitful truth from the genius  of the bard. Blended with the mortal hero,  the aspect of the god glances through the visor  of the helmet, or adds a holy dignity to the  royal crown. Poetry borrows its ornaments from  the lessons of the priests. The ancient god of  strength of the Teutons, throned in his chariot  of the stars, the Northern Wain, invested the  Emperor of the Franks and the paladins who  surrounded him with superhuman might. And  the same constellation, darting down its rays  upon the head of the long-lost Arthur, has  given to the monarch of the Britons the veneration  which once belonged to the son of 'Uthry  Bendragon,' 'Thunder, the supreme leader,' and  'Eygyr, the generating power.' Time rolls on;  faith lessens; the flocks are led to graze within  the rocky circle of the giants, even the bones  of the warriors moulder into dust; the lay is  no longer heard; and the fable, reduced again  to its original simplicity and nudity, becomes  the fitting source of pastime to the untutored  peasant and the listening child. Hence we may  yet trace no small proportion of mystic and  romantic lore in the tales which gladden the  cottage fireside, or, century after century, soothe  the infant to its slumbers.&quot; The works of the  brothers Grimm, the appearance of the Kinder-&nbsp;und Haus-M&auml;hrchen,  in 1812, and of the Deutsche  Mythologie, in 1835, threw a new light on the  importance of national tales, and awoke the  spirit of scientific comparison which has made  the study of Folk-lore productive of such valuable  results.
          With regard to the diffusion of national stories,  it is remarkable that we find substantially identical  narratives flourishing in the most widely separated  countries, and this fact has given rise to several  explanatory theories, none of which seems perfectly  satisfactory. The philological discovery of the  original unity of all the Aryan races may account  for the possession by the Aryan peoples of similar  stories. It may be, as Sir George Cox suggests, a  common inheritance of such tales as were current  when the Aryans &quot;still lived as a single people.&quot;  We find, however, that these tales are also current  among people whom, accepting this theory, we  should least expect to find possessing them, and so  the wide diffusion of the stories yet remains unsatisfactorily  accounted for. Identity of imagination,  inheritance, transmission, may each have played  its part.
          As to the origin of the tales much debate has  arisen. It is obvious from the nature of the incidents  of many of them that they could only have  originated in a most primitive state of man.  &quot;Early man,&quot; says Sir George Cox, &quot;had life,  and therefore all things must have life also. The  sun, the moon, the stars, the ground on which he  trod, the clouds, storms, lightnings were all living  beings; could he help thinking that, like himself,  they were all conscious beings also?&quot; Such, according  to this authority, was the origin of primary  myths, secondary and tertiary myths arising in the  course of time from the gradual misunderstanding  of phrases applied by primitive man to personified  objects. According to Professor Max M&uuml;ller, animism,  or the investing all things with life, springs not  in the first place from man's thought, but from the  language in which he clothes it. Man, he says,  found himself speaking of all things in words having  &quot;a termination expressive of gender, and this  naturally produced in the mind the corresponding  idea of sex.&quot; He thus came to invest all objects  with &quot;something of an individual, active, sexual,  and at last personal character.&quot; However hard it  may be to discover the reason for the origin of the  tendency to animism, the fact is certain that the  tendency is to be found generally existing among  savage peoples, and it would seem that we must  accept the national stories which have come down  to us embodying this tendency in grotesque incidents  as relics handed down from the savage days  of the people with whom the tales originated, as the  expression of portions of their thought when they  had as yet only attained to such a degree of  civilisation as exists among savages of the present  day.
          Strange and grotesque as some of the national  stories are, they may be regarded as embodying  the fragments of some of man's most primitive  beliefs; and recognising this, it will be impossible to  dismiss the folk-tale as unworthy of careful consideration,  nor may it be regarded as unfitted to  afford us, if studied aright, very much more than  merely such amusement as may be derived from its  quaint incident and grotesque plot.
