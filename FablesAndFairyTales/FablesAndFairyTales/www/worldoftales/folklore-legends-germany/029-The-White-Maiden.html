          It is now centuries since a young noble of the  neighbourhood was hunting in the valleys which  lie behind the hills that skirt the Rhine opposite  the ancient town of St. Goar. In the heat of the  pursuit he followed the game to the foot of the  acclivity on which are seated the ruins of Thurnberg,  and there it disappeared all at once from his view. It  was the noon of a midsummer day, and the sun  shone down on him with all its strength. Despairing  of being able to find the object of his pursuit,  he determined to clamber up the steep hillside, and  seek shelter and repose in the shadow of the old  castle, or, mayhap, in one of its many crumbling chambers.  With much labour he succeeded in reaching  the summit, and there, fatigued with his toil, and  parched with a burning thirst, he flung himself on  the ground beneath one of the huge towers, some  of whose remains still rear their heads on high, and  stretched out his tired limbs in the full enjoyment  of rest.
          &quot;Now,&quot; said he, as he wiped the perspiration  from his brow,&mdash;&quot;now could I be happy indeed, if  some kind being would bring me a beaker of the  cool wine, which, they say, is ages old, down there  in the cellars of this castle.&quot;
          He had scarce spoken the words when a most  beautiful maiden stepped forth from a cleft in the  ivy-covered ruin, bearing in one hand a huge silver  beaker of an antique form, full to the very brim of  foaming wine. In her other hand she held a large  bunch of keys of all sizes. She was clad in white  from head to foot, her hair was flaxen, her skin was  like a lily, and she had such loving eyes that they  at once won the heart of the young noble.
          &quot;Here,&quot; said she, handing him the beaker, &quot;thy  wish is granted. Drink and be satisfied.&quot;
          His heart leaped within him with joy at her condescension,  and he emptied the contents of the goblet  at a single draught. All the while she looked at  him in such a manner as to intoxicate his very soul,  so kindly and confidential were her glances. The  wine coursed through his veins like liquid fire, his  heart soon burned with love for the maiden, and  the fever of his blood was by no means appeased by  the furtive looks which ever and anon she cast upon  him. She apparently read his state of mind, and  when his passion was at its highest pitch, and all  restraint seemed put an end to by the potent effects  of love and wine, she disappeared in a moment by  the way she came. The noble rushed after her in  the hope of detaining the fugitive, or, at least, of  catching a parting glimpse of her retreating form,  but the ivy-encircled cleft, through which she seemed  to have flitted, looked as though it had not been  disturbed for centuries, and as he tried to force his  way to the gloomy cavern below, a crowd of bats  and owls and other foul birds of evil omen, aroused  from their repose, rose upwards, and, amidst dismal  hootings and fearful cries, almost flung him backward  with the violence of their flight. He spent  the remainder of the afternoon in search of the lost  one, but without success. At the coming of night  he wended his way homeward, weary, heart-sick,  and overwhelmed with an indefinable sensation of  sadness.
          From that day forth he was an altered man&mdash;altered  in appearance as well as in mind and in  manners. Pleasure was a stranger to his soul, and  he knew no longer what it was to enjoy peace.  Wherever he went, whatever pursuit he was engaged  in, whether in the chase, in the hall, in lady's  bower, or in chapel, his eye only saw one object&mdash;the  White Maiden. At the board she stood in  imagination always before him, offering to his  fevered lips the cool, brimming beaker; and in the  long-drawn aisles of the chapel she was ever  present, beckoning him from his devotions to partake  of the generous beverage which she still bore  in her right hand. Every matron or maiden he  met seemed by some wondrous process to take her  shape, and even the very trees of the forest all  looked to his thought like her.
          Thenceforward he commenced to haunt the ruins  in which she had appeared to him, still hoping to  see, once again, her for whom he felt he was dying,  and living alone in that hope. The sun scorched  him, but it was nothing to the fever that burned  within him. The rain drenched him, but he cared  not for it. Time and change and circumstance  seemed all forgotten by him, everything passed by  him unheeded. His whole existence was completely  swallowed up in one thought&mdash;the White Maiden of  the ruined castle, and that, alas! was only vexation  of spirit. A deadly fever seized him. It was a  mortal disease. Still he raved, in his delirium,  but of her. One morn a woodman, who occasionally  provided him with food, found him a corpse at the  entrance of the crevice in the wall whence the  maiden had seemed to come, and where she had  disappeared. It was long rumoured that he had  struggled bravely with death&mdash;or rather that he  could not die, because the curse was upon him&mdash;until  the maiden, garbed in white as usual, appeared  to him once more. That then he stretched forth  his hands&mdash;she stooped over him. He raised his  head&mdash;she kissed his lips&mdash;and he died.
          The White Maiden, tradition says, has not since  been seen in the ruins of Thurnberg.
