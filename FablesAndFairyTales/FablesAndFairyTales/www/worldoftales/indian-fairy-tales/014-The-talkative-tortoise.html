          The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when Brahma-  datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became the  king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual.
          Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no  opportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this  talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing  so.
          At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a  tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made  friends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate with  him, they said to the tortoise:
          &quot;Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount  Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come  there with us?&quot;
          &quot;But how can I get there?&quot;
          &quot;We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say  nothing to anybody.&quot;
          &quot;Oh! that I can do. Take me with you.&quot;
          &quot;That's right,&quot; said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a  stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up  into the air.
          Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, &quot;Two  wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!&quot; Whereupon the  tortoise wanted to say, &quot;If my friends choose to carry me, what is that  to you, you wretched slaves!&quot; So just as the swift flight of the wild  ducks had brought him over the king's palace in the city of Benares, he  let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open courtyard,  split in two! And there arose a universal cry, &quot;A tortoise has fallen  in the open courtyard, and has split in two!&quot;
          The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by  his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat,  &quot;Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?&quot;
          The future Buddha thought to himself, &quot;Long expecting, wishing to  admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This  tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must have  made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air to take  him to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue when he hears  any one else talk, must have wanted to say something, and let go the  stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and thus lost his  life.&quot; And saying, &quot;Truly, O king! those who are called chatter-boxes&mdash;  people whose words have no end&mdash;come to grief like this,&quot; he uttered  these Verses:
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Verily the tortoise killed himself
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst uttering his voice;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Though he was holding tight the stick,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;By a word himself he slew.
          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Behold him then, O excellent by strength!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And speak wise words, not out of season.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;You see how, by his talking overmuch,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!&quot;
          
          The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, &quot;O Teacher! are  you speaking of us?&quot;
         And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, &quot;O great king! be it thou, or  be it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap  like this.&quot;
      And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few  words.
