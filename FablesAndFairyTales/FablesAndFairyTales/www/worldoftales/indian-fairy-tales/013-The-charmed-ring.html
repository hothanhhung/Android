          A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade  him go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the  money and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some  herdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill.  &quot;Please do not kill the dog,&quot; pleaded the young and tender-hearted  fellow; &quot;I will give you one hundred rupees for it.&quot; Then and there, of  course, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the dog,  and continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting about  a cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. &quot;Oh! please do  not kill it,&quot; said he; &quot;I will give you one hundred rupees for it.&quot; Of  course they at once gave him the cat and took the money. He went on  till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a  snake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill it, but  others did not. &quot;Please do not kill the snake,&quot; said he; &quot;I will give  you one hundred rupees.&quot; Of course the people agreed, and were highly  delighted.
          What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was  gone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went  home.
          &quot;You fool! You scamp!&quot; exclaimed his father when he had heard how his  son had wasted all the money that had been given to him. &quot;Go and live  in the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter my  house.&quot;
          So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass  spread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and  the snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very  fond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by  him at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head,  and the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its  tail on the other.
          One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, &quot;I am  the son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground to  drink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had you  not most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I shall  ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would that you  knew my father! How glad he would be to see his son's preserver!&quot;
          &quot;Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,&quot; said the  young man.
          &quot;Well said!&quot; continued the snake. &quot;Do you see yonder mountain? At the  bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come with  me and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father's country.  Oh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too.  But how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to accept something  at his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you would, perhaps, do  well to reply, 'The ring on your right hand, and the famous pot and  spoon which you possess.' With these in your possession, you would  never need anything, for the ring is such that a man has only to speak  to it, and immediately a beautiful furnished mansion will be provided  for him, while the pot and the spoon will supply him with all manner of  the rarest and most delicious foods.&quot;
          Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and  prepared to jump in, according to the snake's directions. &quot;O master!&quot;  exclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do. &quot;What  shall we do? Where shall we go?&quot;
          &quot;Wait for me here,&quot; he replied. &quot;I am not going far. I shall not be  long away.&quot; On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to  sight.
          &quot;Now what shall we do?&quot; said the dog to the cat. &quot;We must remain here,&quot;  replied the cat, &quot;as our master ordered. Do not be anxious about food.  I will go to the people's houses and get plenty of food for both of  us.&quot; And so the cat did, and they both lived very comfortably till  their master came again and joined them.
          The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and  information of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness  commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake  refused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was released  from this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible death, and  whose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and embraced his son,  and saluting the stranger welcomed him to his dominions. The young man  stayed there a few days, during which he received the Raja's right-hand  ring, and the pot and spoon, in recognition of His Highness's gratitude  to him for having delivered his son. He then returned. On reaching the  top of the spring he found his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting  for him. They told one another all they had experienced since they had  last seen each other, and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked  together to the river side, where it was decided to try the powers of  the charmed ring and pot and spoon.
          The merchant's son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful house  and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the pot  and spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were provided  for them. So he married the princess, and they lived very happily for  several years, until one morning the princess, while arranging her  toilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed and threw them  into the river that flowed along under the window. The reed floated on  the water for many miles, and was at last picked up by the prince of  that country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden hair. On  finding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked himself up in  his room, and would not leave it. He had fallen desperately in love  with the woman whose hair he had picked up, and refused to eat, or  drink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to him. The king, his  father, was in great distress about the matter, and did not know what  to do. He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir.  At last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt, who was an  ogress. The old woman consented to help him, and bade him not to be  anxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the  beautiful woman for his son's wife.
          She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing, and  buzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful  princess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a  stick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful  princess and said, &quot;I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before,  because I left the country just after your birth.&quot; She also embraced  and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The  beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress's  embrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she  could, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress  thought to herself, &quot;I shall soon accomplish my errand.&quot; When she had  been in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring,  and advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter  was constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and  might lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for  the ring, and he readily gave it to her.
          The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious  thing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the  ogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with  it to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point of  death. &quot;Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,&quot; she said to him. &quot;The woman  for whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the charm,  whereby you may bring her before you.&quot; The prince was almost mad with  joy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing the  beautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the  house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace  garden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful  princess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no  escape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he  would wait one month for her.
          Meanwhile the merchant's son had returned from hunting and was terribly  distressed not to find his house and wife. There was the place only,  just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which Raja  Indrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put an end to  himself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone away and  hidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything disappear. &quot;O  master!&quot; they said, &quot;stay your hand. Your trial is great, but it can be  remedied. Give us one month, and we will go and try to recover your  wife and house.&quot;
          &quot;Go,&quot; said he, &quot;and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my  wife, and I shall live.&quot;
          So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they  reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken.  &quot;We may have some difficulty here,&quot; said the cat. &quot;Look, the king has  taken our master's wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will go  to the house and try to see her.&quot; So the dog sat down, and the cat  climbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess  was sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and informed  it of all that had happened to her since she had left them.
          &quot;But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?&quot; she  asked.
          &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the cat, &quot;if you can tell me where the charmed ring is.&quot;
          &quot;The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,&quot; she said.
          &quot;All right,&quot; said the cat, &quot;I will recover it. If we once get it,  everything is ours.&quot; Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and  went and laid down by a rat's hole and pretended she was dead. Now at  that time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat  community of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were  assembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down.  The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The cat  got to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the  bridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently, when  the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping in  honour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and  pounced down on him. &quot;Oh! let me go, let me go,&quot; cried the terrified  rat. &quot;Oh! let him go,&quot; squealed all the company. &quot;It is his wedding  day.&quot;
          &quot;No, no,&quot; replied the cat. &quot;Not unless you do some thing for me.  Listen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his  wife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will procure  it for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then  your prince dies under my feet.&quot;
          &quot;Very well, we agree,&quot; said they all. &quot;Nay, if we do not get the ring  for you, devour us all.&quot;
          This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At  midnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her  bedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail into her throat;  whereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and  rolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing  and ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and went at once to  the cat and released its son.
          As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to  go and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They  had only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the  house and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything  would go on as happily as before. &quot;How glad master will be!&quot; they  thought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the  way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its  back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring, and  threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up;  whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at once  dropped it, and a fish swallowed it.
          &quot;Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?&quot; said the dog.
          &quot;What is done is done,&quot; replied the cat. &quot;We must try to recover it,  and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream.  I have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me.&quot;
          &quot;All right,&quot; said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with  a dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and  lay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet.  Not long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of  a fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on  it to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the  bird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring.  This was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off  to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to  restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was found  and carried back to the cat.
          &quot;Come along now; I have got the ring,&quot; said the cat to the dog.
          &quot;No, I will not,&quot; said the dog, &quot;unless you let me have the ring. I can  carry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you.&quot; So the cat  was obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it  again. This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite.
          &quot;See, see, there it goes&mdash;away to that big tree,&quot; the cat exclaimed.
          &quot;Oh! oh! what have I done?&quot; cried the dog.
          &quot;You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,&quot; said the cat. &quot;But stop  your barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we  shall not be able to trace it.&quot;
         The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree,  killed the kite, and recovered the ring. &quot;Come along,&quot; it said to the  dog when it reached the ground. &quot;We must make haste now. We have been  delayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on.&quot;
      The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat's pardon for  all the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the  third time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and  gave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into  joy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house reappeared,  and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be.
