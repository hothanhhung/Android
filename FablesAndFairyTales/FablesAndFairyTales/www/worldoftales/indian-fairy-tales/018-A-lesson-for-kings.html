          Once upon a time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the future  Buddha returned to life as his son and heir. And when the day came for  choosing a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew up in due  course; and when he was sixteen years old, went to Takkasila, and  became accomplished in all arts. And after his father died he ascended  the throne, and ruled the kingdom with righteousness and equity. He  gave judgments without partiality, hatred, ignorance, or fear. Since he  thus reigned with justice, with justice also his ministers administered  the law. Lawsuits being thus decided with justice, there were none who  brought false cases. And as these ceased, the noise and tumult of  litigation ceased in the king's court. Though the judges sat all day in  the court, they had to leave without any one coming for justice. It  came to this, that the Hall of Justice would have to be closed!
          Then the future Buddha thought, &quot;It cannot be from my reigning with  righteousness that none come for judgment; the bustle has ceased, and  the Hall of Justice will have to be closed. I must, therefore, now  examine into my own faults; and if I find that anything is wrong in me,  put that away, and practise only virtue.&quot;
          Thenceforth he sought for some one to tell him his faults, but among  those around him he found no one who would tell him of any fault, but  heard only his own praise.
          Then he thought, &quot;It is from fear of me that these men speak only good  things, and not evil things,&quot; and he sought among those people who  lived outside the palace. And finding no fault-finder there, he sought  among those who lived outside the city, in the suburbs, at the four  gates. And there too finding no one to find fault, and hearing only his  own praise, he determined to search the country places.
          So he made over the kingdom to his ministers, and mounted his chariot;  and taking only his charioteer, left the city in disguise. And  searching the country through, up to the very boundary, he found no  fault-finder, and heard only of his own virtue; and so he turned back  from the outer-most boundary, and returned by the high road towards the  city.
          Now at that time the king of Kosala, Mallika by name, was also ruling  his kingdom with righteousness; and when seeking for some fault in  himself, he also found no fault-finder in the palace, but only heard of  his own virtue! So seeking in country places, he too came to that very  spot. And these two came face to face in a low cart-track with  precipitous sides, where there was no space for a chariot to get out of  the way!
          Then the charioteer of Mallika the king said to the charioteer of the  king of Benares, &quot;Take thy chariot out of the way!&quot;
          But he said, &quot;Take thy chariot out of the way, O charioteer! In this  chariot sitteth the lord over the kingdom of Benares, the great king  Brahma-datta.&quot;
          Yet the other replied, &quot;In this chariot, O charioteer, sitteth the lord  over the kingdom of Kosala, the great king Mallika. Take thy carriage  out of the way, and make room for the chariot of our king!&quot;
          Then the charioteer of the king of Benares thought, &quot;They say then that  he too is a king! What is now to be done?&quot; After some consideration,  he said to himself, &quot;I know a way. I'll find out how old he is, and then  I'll let the chariot of the younger be got out of the way, and so make  room for the elder.&quot;
          And when he had arrived at that conclusion, he asked that charioteer  what the age of the king of Kosala was. But on inquiry he found that  the ages of both were equal. Then he inquired about the extent of his  kingdom, and about his army, and his wealth, and his renown, and about  the country he lived in, and his caste and tribe and family. And he  found that both were lords of a kingdom three hundred leagues in  extent; and that in respect of army and wealth and renown, and the  countries in which they lived, and their caste and their tribe and  their family, they were just on a par!
          Then he thought, &quot;I will make way for the most righteous.&quot; And he  asked, &quot;What kind of righteousness has this king of yours?&quot;
          Then the chorister of the king of Kosala, proclaiming his king's  wickedness as goodness, uttered the First Stanza:
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The strong he overthrows by strength,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The mild by mildness, does Mallika;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The good he conquers by goodness,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And the wicked by wickedness too.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the nature of this king!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move out of the way, O charioteer!&quot;
          
          But the charioteer of the king of Benares asked him, &quot;Well, have you  told all the virtues of your king?&quot;
          &quot;Yes,&quot; said the other.
          &quot;If these are his virtues, where are then his faults?&quot; replied  he.
          The other said, &quot;Well, for the nonce, they shall be faults, if you  like! But pray, then, what is the kind of goodness your king has?&quot;
          And then the charioteer of the king of Benares called unto him to  hearken, and uttered the Second Stanza
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anger he conquers by calmness,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And by goodness the wicked;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The stingy he conquers by gifts,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And by truth the speaker of lies.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the nature of this king!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move out of the way, O charioteer!&quot;
          
      And when he had thus spoken, both Mallika the king and his charioteer  alighted from their chariot. And they took out the horses, and removed  their chariot, and made way for the king of Benares!
