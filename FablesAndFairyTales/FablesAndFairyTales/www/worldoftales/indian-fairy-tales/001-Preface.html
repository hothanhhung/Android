          From the extreme West of the Indo-European world, we go this year to  the extreme East. From the soft rain and green turf of Gaeldom, we seek  the garish sun and arid soil of the Hindoo. In the Land of Ire, the  belief in fairies, gnomes, ogres and monsters is all but dead; in the  Land of Ind it still flourishes in all the vigour of animism.
          Soils and national characters differ; but fairy tales are the same in  plot and incidents, if not in treatment. The majority of the tales in  this volume have been known in the West in some form or other, and the  problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in  farthest West and East. Some&mdash;as Benfey in Germany, M. Cosquin in  France, and Mr. Clouston in England&mdash;have declared that India is the  Home of the Fairy Tale, and that all European fairy tales have been  brought from thence by Crusaders, by Mongol missionaries, by Gipsies,  by Jews, by traders, by travellers. The question is still before the  courts, and one can only deal with it as an advocate. So far as my  instructions go, I should be prepared, within certain limits, to hold a  brief for India. So far as the children of Europe have their fairy  stories in common, these&mdash;and they form more than a third of the whole  &mdash;are derived from India. In particular, the majority of the Drolls or  comic tales and jingles can be traced, without much difficulty, back to  the Indian peninsula.
          Certainly there is abundant evidence of the early transmission by  literary means of a considerable number of drolls and folk-tales from  India about the time of the Crusaders. The collections known in Europe  by the titles of The Fables of Bidpai, The Seven Wise Masters, Gesia  Romanorum, and Barlaam and Josaphat, were extremely popular  during the Middle Ages, and their contents passed on the one hand into  the Exempla of the monkish preachers, and on the other into the Novelle of Italy, thence, after many days, to contribute their  quota to the Elizabethan Drama. Perhaps nearly one-tenth of the main  incidents of European folktales can be traced to this source.
          There are even indications of an earlier literary contact between  Europe and India, in the case of one branch of the folk-tale, the Fable  or Beast Droll. In a somewhat elaborate discussion [Footnote: &quot;History  of the Aesopic Fable,&quot; the introductory volume to my edition of Caxton's Fables of Esope (London, Nutt, 1889).] I have come to the  conclusion that a goodly number of the fables that pass under the name  of the Samian slave, Aesop, were derived from India, probably from the  same source whence the same tales were utilised in the Jatakas, or  Birth-stories of Buddha. These Jatakas contain a large quantity of  genuine early Indian folk-tales, and form the earliest collection of  folk-tales in the world, a sort of Indian Grimm, collected more than  two thousand years before the good German brothers went on their quest  among the folk with such delightful results. For this reason I have  included a considerable number of them in this volume; and shall be  surprised if tales that have roused the laughter and wonder of pious  Buddhists for the last two thousand years, cannot produce the same  effect on English children. The Jatakas have been fortunate in their  English translators, who render with vigour and point; and I rejoice  in being able to publish the translation of two new Jatakas, kindly  done into English for this volume by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse, of Christ's  College, Cambridge. In one of these I think I have traced the source  of the Tar Baby incident in &quot;Uncle Remus.&quot;
          Though Indian fairy tales are the earliest in existence, yet they are  also from another point of view the youngest. For it is only about  twenty-five years ago that Miss Frere began the modern collection of  Indian folk-tales with her charming &quot;Old Deccan Days&quot; (London, John  Murray, 1868; fourth edition, 1889). Her example has been followed by  Miss Stokes, by Mrs. Steel, and Captain (now Major) Temple, by the  Pandit Natesa Sastri, by Mr. Knowles and Mr. Campbell, as well as  others who have published folk-tales in such periodicals as the Indian Antiquary and The Orientalist. The story-store of  modern India has been well dipped into during the last quarter of a  century, though the immense range of the country leaves room for any  number of additional workers and collections. Even so far as the  materials already collected go, a large number of the commonest  incidents in European folk-tales have been found in India. Whether  brought there or born there, we have scarcely any criterion for  judging; but as some of those still current among the folk in India can  be traced back more than a millennium, the presumption is in favour of  an Indian origin.
          From all these sources&mdash;from the Jatakas, from the Bidpai, and from the  more recent collections&mdash;I have selected those stories which throw most  light on the origin of Fable and Folk-tales, and at the same time are  most likely to attract English children. I have not, however, included  too many stories of the Grimm types, lest I should repeat the contents  of the two preceding volumes of this series. This has to some degree  weakened the case for India as represented by this book. The need of  catering for the young ones has restricted my selection from the well-  named &quot;Ocean of the Streams of Story,&quot; Katha-Sarit Sagara of  Somadeva. The stories existing in Pali and Sanskrit I have taken from  translations, mostly from the German of Benfey or the vigorous English  of Professor Rhys-Davids, whom I have to thank for permission to use  his versions of the Jatakas.
          I have been enabled to make this book a representative collection of  the Fairy Tales of Ind by the kindness of the original collectors or  their publishers. I have especially to thank Miss Frere, who kindly  made an exception in my favour, and granted me the use of that fine  story, &quot;Punchkin,&quot; and that quaint myth, &quot;How Sun, Moon, and Wind went  out to Dinner.&quot; Miss Stokes has been equally gracious in granting me  the use of characteristic specimens from her &quot;Indian Fairy Tales.&quot; To  Major Temple I owe the advantage of selecting from his admirable Wideawake Stories, and Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co. have  allowed me to use Mr. Knowles' &quot;Folk-tales of Kashmir,&quot; in their  Oriental Library; and Messrs. W. H. Allen have been equally obliging  with regard to Mrs. Kingscote's &quot;Tales of the Sun.&quot; Mr. M. L. Dames has  enabled me add to the published story-store of India by granting me the  use of one from his inedited collection of Baluchi folk-tales.
        I have again to congratulate myself an the co-operation of my friend  Mr. J. D. Batten in giving beautiful or amusing form to the creations  of the folk fancy of the Hindoos. It is no slight thing to embody, as  he has done, the glamour and the humour both of the Celt and of the  Hindoo. It is only a further proof that Fairy Tales are something more  than Celtic or Hindoo. They are human.
