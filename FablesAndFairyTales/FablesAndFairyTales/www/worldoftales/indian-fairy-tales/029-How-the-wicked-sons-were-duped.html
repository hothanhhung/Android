          A very wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death,  sent for his sons and divided his property among them. However, he did  not die for several years afterwards; and miserable years many of them  were. Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bear with  much abuse and cruelty from his sons. Wretched, selfish ingrates!  Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father,  hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received their  patrimony, they cared not how soon he left them&mdash;nay, the sooner the  better, because he was only a needless trouble and expense. And they  let the poor old man know what they felt.
          One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. The friend  sympathised very much with him, and promised to think over the matter,  and call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so; in a  few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones  and gravel before him.
         &quot;Look here, friend,&quot; said he. &quot;Your sons will get to know of my coming  here to-day, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I came to  discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are several  thousands of rupees richer than you thought you were. Keep these bags  in your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as long  as you are alive. You will soon find them change their conduct towards  you. Salaam. I will come again soon to see how you are getting on.&quot;
      When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth they  began to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than ever  before. And thus they continued to the day of the old man's demise,  when the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stones  and gravel!
