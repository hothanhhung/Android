          Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.  They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more  clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little  children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to  take care of them.
          The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner  every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the  affairs of the nation.
          About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and  every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their  father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg  for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her  sisters, &quot;Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at  her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come  here, we shall suffer for it some day.&quot;
          But the other sisters would answer, &quot;Be quiet, Balna; why must you  always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if  she likes.&quot; Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take  a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly  throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared  for the Raja's dinner.
          Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's  death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to  avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he  found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from  their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have  put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to  reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated  many successive days.
          At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters  cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room,  and watched them through a hole in the wall.
          There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and  preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the  fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to  the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner  with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, &quot;Why don't you keep fuel  in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters,  don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself.&quot;
          Then the eldest sister answered, &quot;Balna, let the poor woman take the  wood and the fire; she does us no harm.&quot; But Balna replied, &quot;If you let  her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us  sorry for it, some day.&quot;
          The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his  dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a  little mud into each of the dishes.
          At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and  brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had  played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and  she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words,  that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his  Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.
          Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get  them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might  have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their  place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her,  she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but  bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink;  so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have  everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all  their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go  out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry&mdash;and say:
          &quot;Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we  are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?&quot;
          One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a  beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe  pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the  fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad  dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to  their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the  beautiful tree.
          Then the Ranee said to her daughter, &quot;I cannot tell how it is, every  day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat  any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than  you do. I cannot tell how it is.&quot; And she bade her watch the seven  Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat.
          So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were  eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them,  and saw them gathering the fruit.
          Then Balna said to her sisters, &quot;Do you not see that girl watching us?  Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell  her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us.&quot;
          But the other sisters said, &quot;Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl  would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite her  to come and have some of the fruit.&quot; And calling her to them, they gave  her one of the pomeloes.
          No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went  home and said to her mother, &quot;I do not wonder the seven Princesses will  not eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's grave  there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day and  eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever tasted.&quot;
          The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she  stayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache.  The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, &quot;What can I do for  you?&quot; She answered, &quot;There is only one thing that will make my headache  well. By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree; you must  bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put a little of the  water in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and that will cure  my headache.&quot; So the Raja sent his servants, and had the beautiful  pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee desired; and  when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was put on her  forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well.
          Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of their  mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to cry  very bitterly.
          Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were crying  they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance,  which quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all the  Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it;  and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days.  Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and found  the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake. Then the  cruel step-mother said to her daughter: &quot;I cannot tell how it is, I  have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave  destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad,  though they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot tell how it is!&quot;
          And her daughter said, &quot;I will watch.&quot;
          Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should  come by but their step-mother's daughter. Balna saw her first, and  said, &quot;See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the  edge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some  of our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very  unfortunate for us.&quot;
          The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, and  instead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter some  of the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.
          The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly  angry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and  fill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she  next day pretended to be very, very ill&mdash;in fact, at the point of  death&mdash;and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was  in his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: &quot;Only one  thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it.&quot; He replied,  &quot;Yes, whatever it is, I will do it.&quot; She then said, &quot;To save my life,  you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of  their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their  death will be my life.&quot; At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but  because he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to  find his daughters.
          He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.
          Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them,  and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made a  fire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the afternoon,  it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when he  saw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and left  them (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: &quot;It is better my poor  daughters should die here, than be killed by their step-mother.&quot;
          He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the  forehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had  really killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.
          Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves all  alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to call  out as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but he  was by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear them  even had their voices been as loud as thunder.
          It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a  neighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as  they were returning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest  Prince said to his brothers &quot;Stop, I think I hear some one crying and  calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of the  sound, and find out what it is.&quot;
          So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place  where the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands. At the  sight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and still  more so on learning their story; and they settled that each should take  one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her.
          So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him,  and married her.
          And the second took the second;
          And the third took the third;
          And the fourth took the fourth;
          And the fifth took the fifth;
          And the sixth took the sixth;
          And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna.
          And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing  throughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to  seven such beautiful Princesses.
          About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and  aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers  and seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any  children, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged  their heir by all the rest.
          They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the  seventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and away  he went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back.
          Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of  him; and they went away, but they also did not return.
          And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their  kind husbands must have been killed.
          One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her  baby's cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below,  there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said  that he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, &quot;You  cannot go into the palace&mdash;the Raja's sons have all gone away; we think  they must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by your  begging.&quot; But he said, &quot;I am a holy man, you must let me in.&quot; Then the  stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not know  that this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.
          Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautiful  things there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing  beside her little boy's cradle. The Magician thought her more beautiful  than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuch that he asked  her to go home with him and to marry him. But she said, &quot;My husband, I  fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young; I will stay here  and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he is grown up he shall  go out into the world, and try and learn tidings of his father. Heaven  forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry you.&quot; At these words the  Magician was very angry, and turned her into a little black dog, and  led her away; saying, &quot;Since you will not come with me of your own free  will, I will make you.&quot; So the poor Princess was dragged away, without  any power of effecting an escape, or of letting her sisters know what  had become of her. As Punchkin passed through the palace gate the  servants said to him, &quot;Where did you get that pretty little dog?&quot; And  he answered, &quot;One of the Princesses gave it to me as a present.&quot; At  hearing which they let him go without further questioning.
          Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, their  nephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were much  surprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then  they questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and the  little black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in every  direction seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to be  found. What could six poor women do? They gave up all hopes of ever  seeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband, again,  and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of  their little nephew.
          Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old. Then, one  day, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did he  hear it, than he was seized with a great desire to go in search of his  father and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to bring  them home again. His aunts, on learning his determination, were much  alarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, &quot;We have lost our husbands,  and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole hope; if you  go away, what shall we do?&quot; But he replied, &quot;I pray you not to be  discouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring my father  and mother and uncles with me.&quot; So he set out on his travels; but for  some months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.
          At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, and  become almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents,  he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, and  trees, and there he saw a large palace with a high tower; hard by which  was a Malee's little house.
          As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of the  house and said, &quot;My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to this  dangerous place?&quot; He answered, &quot;I am a Raja's son, and I come in search  of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wicked enchanter  bewitched.&quot;
          Then the Malee's wife said, &quot;This country and this palace belong to a  great enchanter; he is all powerful, and if any one displeases him, he  can turn them into stones and trees. All the rocks and trees you see  here were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what they  now are. Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly afterwards  came his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones and trees;  and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower lives  a beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner there for  twelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him.&quot;
          Then the little Prince thought, &quot;These must be my parents and my  uncles. I have found what I seek at last.&quot; So he told his story to the  Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that place awhile  and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned; and  she promised to befriend him, and advised his disguising himself lest  the Magician should see him, and turn him likewise into stone. To this  the Prince agreed. So the Malee's wife dressed him up in a saree, and  pretended that he was her daughter.
          One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his garden  he saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her who  she was. She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the Magician  said, &quot;You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take a  present of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in the  tower.&quot;
          The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and went  immediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom he  determined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise,  and trust to the chance of a favourable opportunity for establishing  some communication with his mother, if it were indeed she.
          Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her a  small gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it on  her little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterwards when he was  older his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still able  to wear it. The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-known  treasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trust  to her recognising it. This was not to be done without difficulty, as  such a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of her  ever establishing communication with her friends), that though the  supposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day,  the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.  At last one day, however, opportunity favoured him, and when no one was  looking, the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna's  feet. It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to see what  made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers. On  recognising it, she at once believed the story her son told her of his  long search, and begged him to advise her as to what she had better do;  at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his life by  trying to rescue her. She told him that for twelve long years the  Magician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marry  him, and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release.
          Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, &quot;Do not fear,  dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far the  Magician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate my  father and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks and  trees. You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; now rather  speak kindly. Tell him you have given up all hopes of again seeing the  husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing to marry him.  Then endeavour to find out what his power consists in, and whether he  is immortal, or can be put to death.&quot;
          Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent for
            Punchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested.
          
          The Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to  take place as soon as possible.
          But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little  more time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that, after  being enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen by  degrees. &quot;And do tell me,&quot; she said, &quot;are you quite immortal? Can death  never touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human  suffering?&quot;
          &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; said he.
          &quot;Because,&quot; she replied, &quot;if I am to be your wife, I would fain know all  about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, or if  possible to avert it.&quot;
          &quot;It is true,&quot; he added, &quot;that I am not as others. Far, far away,  hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate country  covered with thick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of  palm trees, and in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of  water, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a small cage  which contains a little green parrot; on the life of the parrot depends  my life; and if the parrot is killed I must die. It is, however,&quot; he  added, &quot;impossible that the parrot should sustain any injury, both on  account of the inaccessibility of the country, and because, by my  appointment, many thousand genii surround the palm trees, and kill all  who approach the place.&quot;
          Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same time  implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.
          The Prince, however, replied, &quot;Mother, unless I can get hold of that  parrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be not  afraid, I will shortly return. Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in  good humour&mdash;still putting off your marriage with him on various  pretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here.&quot;  So saying, he went away.
          Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thick  jungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep.  He was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw a  large serpent which was making its way to an eagle's nest built in the  tree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles. The  Prince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and killed  the serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air,  and the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for their  young ones, returned. They quickly saw the dead serpent and the young  Prince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, &quot;Dear  boy, for many years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel  serpent; you have now saved the lives of our children; whenever you are  in need, therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as for these  little eagles, take them, and let them be your servants.&quot;
          At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed their  wings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over the  thick jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle of palm  trees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water. It  was the middle of the day, and the heat was very great. All round the  trees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were such  countless thousands of them, that it would have been quite impossible  for any one to walk through their ranks to the place; down swooped the  strong-winged eaglets&mdash;down jumped the Prince; in an instant he had  overthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized the little green  parrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted again  into the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasure  gone, set up a wild and melancholy howl.
          Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in the  great tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, &quot;Take back your  little ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand in  need of help, I will not fail to come to you.&quot; He then continued his  journey on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician's palace,  where he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot.  Punchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, &quot;My boy, where did  you get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray you.&quot;
          But the Prince answered, &quot;Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is a  great pet of mine; I have had it many years.&quot;
          Then the Magician said, &quot;If it is an old favourite, I can understand  your not caring to give it away; but come what will you sell it for?&quot;
          &quot;Sir,&quot; replied the Prince, &quot;I will not sell my parrot.&quot;
          Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, &quot;Anything, anything; name what  price you will, and it shall be yours.&quot; The Prince answered, &quot;Let the  seven Raja's sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly  liberated.&quot;
          &quot;It is done as you desire,&quot; said the Magician, &quot;only give me my  parrot.&quot; And with that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna's husband and  his brothers resumed their natural shapes. &quot;Now, give me my parrot,&quot;  repeated Punchkin.
          &quot;Not so fast, my master,&quot; rejoined the Prince; &quot;I must first beg that  you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned.&quot;
          The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried, in  an imploring voice, &quot;Give me my parrot!&quot; the whole garden became  suddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before,  stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses,  and jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants.
          &quot;Give me my parrot!&quot; cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the  parrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician's  right arm fell off.
          Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, &quot;Give me my parrot!&quot;  The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's left  arm tumbled off.
          &quot;Give me my parrot!&quot; cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince pulled  off the parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off: the  Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's left.
         Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still  he rolled his eyes, and cried, &quot;Give me my parrot!&quot; &quot;Take your parrot,  then,&quot; cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and threw  it at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted round,  and, with a fearful groan, he died!
      Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven  Princes went to their own country, and lived very happily ever  afterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own  house.
