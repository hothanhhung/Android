          Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees  and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun,  who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red  cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing  with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which  was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees.  They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat  them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and  write.
          One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to  his father, &quot;Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt.&quot; His  father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else  they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting  all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds.
          The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a  daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and  black hair.
          One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom,  as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told  her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this  was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the  angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to  her story. From that time she began repeating, &quot;Majnun, Majnun; I want  Majnun,&quot; and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food  she kept saying, &quot;Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.&quot; Her father used to  get quite vexed with her. &quot;Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this  Majnun?&quot; he would say.
          &quot;He is the man I am to marry,&quot; said Laili. &quot;Khuda has ordered me to  marry no one but Majnun.&quot; And she was half mad.
          Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana  country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to  eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying,  &quot;Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.&quot; The prince heard her, and turned  round. &quot;Who is calling me?&quot; he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and  the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said  to herself, &quot;I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am  to marry.&quot; And she went home to her father and said, &quot;Father, I wish to  marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the  Prince Majnun I am to marry.&quot;
          &quot;Very well, you shall have him for your husband,&quot; said Munsuk Raja. &quot;We  will ask him to-morrow.&quot; Laili consented to wait, although she was very  impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that  night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would  not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to  her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle,  till she got farther and farther away from her own country. All the  time she kept saying, &quot;Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;&quot; and so she  wandered about for twelve years.
          At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir&mdash;he was really an angel,  but she did not know this&mdash;who asked her, &quot;Why do you always say,  'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?&quot; She answered, &quot;I am the daughter of  the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell  me where his kingdom is.&quot;
          &quot;I think you will never get there,&quot; said the fakir, &quot;for it is very far  from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it.&quot; But Laili  said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. &quot;Well,&quot; said the  fakir, &quot;when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish,  a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country,  or you will never reach it.&quot;
          She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river. There  was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she  got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its  stomach. All the time she kept saying, &quot;Majnun, Majnun.&quot; At this the  Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he  could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and  perched on his back, and said &quot;Caw, caw.&quot; &quot;Oh, Mr. Crow,&quot; said the poor  fish &quot;do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise.&quot;
          &quot;Very well,&quot; said the crow, &quot;open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down  and see.&quot;
          So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up  again very quickly. &quot;You have a Rakshas in your stomach,&quot; said the  crow, and he flew away.
          This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he  came to Prince Majnun's country. There he stopped. And a jackal came  down to the river to drink. &quot;Oh, jackal,&quot; said the Rohu &quot;do tell me  what I have inside me.&quot;
          &quot;How can I tell?&quot; said the jackal. &quot;I cannot see unless I go inside  you.&quot; So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his  throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and  saying, &quot;You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away  quickly, I am afraid it will eat me.&quot; So off he ran. After the jackal  came an enormous snake. &quot;Oh,&quot; says the fish, &quot;do tell me what I have in  my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun;  I want Majnun.'&quot;
          The snake said, &quot;Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what it  is.&quot; The snake went down: when he returned he said, &quot;You have a Rakshas  in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out  of you.&quot; &quot;If you do that, I shall die,&quot; said the Rohu. &quot;Oh, no,&quot; said  the snake, &quot;you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make  you quite well again.&quot; So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife  and cut him open, and out jumped Laili.
          She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle,  and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no  longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his  back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and  she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where King  Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, &quot;Majnun, Majnun; I  want Majnun,&quot; and they asked her what she wanted. &quot;I want King Majnun,&quot;  she said.
          So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, &quot;An old woman outside says  she wants you.&quot; &quot;I cannot leave this place,&quot; said he; &quot;send her in  here.&quot; They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted. &quot;I  want to marry you,&quot; she answered. &quot;Twenty-four years ago you came to my  father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you then; but  you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered  about all these years looking for you.&quot; Prince Majnun said, &quot;Very  good.&quot;
          &quot;Pray to Khuda,&quot; said Laili, &quot;to make us both young again, and then we  shall be married.&quot; So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to  him, &quot;Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are  on fire, she and you will become young again.&quot; When he touched Laili's  clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again. And there  were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana  country to see her father and mother.
          Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that  they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating,  &quot;Laili, Laili, Laili.&quot; When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to  Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the  father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then  they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince  Majnum and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years,  and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time  with him. They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country  to country to eat the air and amuse themselves.
          One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, &quot;Let us go through this jungle.&quot;  &quot;No, no,&quot; said Laili; &quot;if we go through this jungle, some harm will  happen to me.&quot; But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle. And  as they were going through it, Khuda thought, &quot;I should like to know  how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she  died? And would he marry another wife? I will see.&quot; So he sent one of  his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went  up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell  to the ground a heap of ashes.
          Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili  turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his  father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a  great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again  into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal  wished his son to marry again. &quot;I will only have Laili for my wife; I  will not marry any other woman,&quot; said Prince Majnun.
          &quot;How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to  you,&quot; said the father. &quot;Then I'll not have any wife at all,&quot; said  Prince Majnun.
          Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her  a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken  her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and  water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so  Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili  had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and  teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she  had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the  jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, &quot;Majnun,  Majnun; I want Majnun.&quot;
          At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her,  said to Khuda, &quot;Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the  jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,' and  eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot;  said Khuda, &quot;you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to  Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is  afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next  day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human  shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and  lets her sleep in his bed.&quot;
          So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King  Dantal's garden. &quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;it is Khuda's command that you stay  here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may  show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of  you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a  little white dog.&quot; He then told her what she must do as a little dog to  regain her human form.
          Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince  Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was  now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as  old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who  had been made quite young again when he married Laili.
          As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they  gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit  the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy  eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he  turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son.
          &quot;Oh, look, look!&quot; he cried, &quot;see what is following you; it is a Rakshas  or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us.&quot; Laili looked at him  beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness;  but this only frightened Majnun the more. &quot;It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!&quot;  he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's son; and as  they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King  Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the  garden that had come to eat them.
          &quot;What nonsense,&quot; said his father. &quot;Fancy two grown men being so  frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it  would not have eaten you.&quot; Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun  had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was  speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible  old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very  silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk  in the garden any more.
          The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape  she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of  her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out  hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her  with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the  little dog slept in his bed.
          But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay  the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and  now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some  such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out,  &quot;What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!&quot; Poor Laili  answered, &quot;Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry  you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I  begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen  to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became  a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here,  after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and  now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall  not be a little dog any more.&quot; Majnun, however, said &quot;How can I marry  an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a  Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,&quot; and he was in great terror.
          In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the  prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. &quot;An old  woman! an old woman! always an old woman!&quot; said his father. &quot;You do  nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so  easily frightened?&quot; However, when he saw that his son was really in  great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back  at night, he advised him to say to her, &quot;I will marry you if you can  make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as  you are?&quot;
          That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in  place of the dog, crying &quot;Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have  loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's kingdom  a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we  should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and  for long, long years I followed you.&quot;
          &quot;Well,&quot; said Majnun, &quot;if you can make yourself a young girl again, I  will marry you.&quot;
          Laili said, &quot;Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl  again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you  will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your  room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it  when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite  alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at  all on.&quot; In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and  disappeared in the garden.
          Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the  old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son  walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit.  &quot;Oh!&quot; said the Prince, &quot;I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit.&quot;  Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till  he had told his father, who said, &quot;That must be the fruit; go and  gather it.&quot; So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and  he said to his father, &quot;Come with me to my room while I open it; I am  afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that  will eat me.&quot;
          &quot;No,&quot; said King Dantal; &quot;remember, Laili will be naked; you must go  alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit,  for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a  loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to  eat you.&quot;
          Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he  shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and  far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme  beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor.
          Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari  (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal,  and said to him sadly, &quot;Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will  he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen  me so many, many times.&quot;
          King Dantal answered, &quot;It is because you are so beautiful. You are far,  far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy  directly.&quot; Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face  and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again.
          Then Laili said, &quot;Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?&quot;
          &quot;Oh!&quot; said Prince Majnun, &quot;I see you are Laili come back to me, but  your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I  saw them.&quot; Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the  drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played  on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the  servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs.
          After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife  went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a  groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden.  &quot;We must go into that garden and see it,&quot; said Majnun.
          &quot;No, no,&quot; said Laili; &quot;it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very  wicked man.&quot; But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili  could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was  looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and  she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her.  So she said to Majnun, &quot;Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad  man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you  to seize me.&quot;
          &quot;What nonsense,&quot; said Majnun. &quot;I believe he is a very good Raja.
            Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away.&quot;
          
          &quot;Well,&quot; said Laili, &quot;it is better that you should be killed than I, for  if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life  again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed.&quot; Now Chumman Basa  had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince  Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and  cut off the prince's head at one blow.
          Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her  she said, &quot;Why did you kill my husband?&quot;
          &quot;Because I want to take you,&quot; he answered.
          &quot;You cannot,&quot; said Laili.
          &quot;Yes, I can,&quot; said the Raja.
          &quot;Take me, then,&quot; said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and  put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put  her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her  hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it  was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and  her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one touch.
          Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead  body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from  the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like  healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and  smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and  said, &quot;What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had  slept for years!&quot; Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by  Laili's horse.
          &quot;What's that?&quot; said Majnun.
          &quot;That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he  would.&quot;
          &quot;Who killed him?&quot; asked Majnun.
          &quot;I did,&quot; answered Laili, &quot;and it was I who brought you to life.&quot;
          &quot;Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,&quot; said Majnun.
          &quot;No,&quot; said Laili, &quot;for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you  harm.&quot; But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to  bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, &quot;Jump up on the  horse, then, and go far away with the groom.&quot;
          &quot;What will you do,&quot; said Majnun, &quot;if I leave you? I cannot leave you.&quot;
         &quot;I will take care of myself,&quot; said Laili; &quot;but this man is so wicked,  he may kill you again if you are near him.&quot; So Majnun got up on the  horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili.  Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and she  squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out  of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed,  and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and  she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch  her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode  so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's palace.
      There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified  and angry. &quot;How lucky for you that you have such a wife,&quot; he said. &quot;Why  did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead.&quot;  Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's safety, and  gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He  loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a  splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about  it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of  servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants  to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go  out of them, nor Laili; &quot;for,&quot; said King Dantal, &quot;Laili is so  beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away.&quot;
