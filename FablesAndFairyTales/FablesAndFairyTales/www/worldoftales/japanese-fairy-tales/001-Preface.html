           This collection of Japanese fairy tales is the outcome of a suggestion  made to me indirectly through a friend by Mr. Andrew Lang. They have  been translated from the modern version written by Sadanami Sanjin.  These stories are not literal translations, and though the Japanese  story and all quaint Japanese expressions have been faithfully  preserved, they have been told more with the view to interest young  readers of the West than the technical student of folk-lore. 
    Grateful acknowledgment is due to Mr. Y. Yasuoka, Miss Fusa Okamoto, my  brother Nobumori Ozaki, Dr. Yoshihiro Takaki, and Miss Kameko Yamao,  who have helped me with translations. 
    The story which I have named &quot;The Story of the Man who did not Wish to  Die&quot; is taken from a little book written a hundred years ago by one  Shinsui Tamenaga. It is named Chosei Furo, or &quot;Longevity.&quot; &quot;The  Bamboo-cutter and the Moon-child&quot; is taken from the classic &quot;Taketari  Monogatari,&quot; and is NOT classed by the Japanese among their fairy  tales, though it really belongs to this class of literature. 
    The pictures were drawn by Mr. Kakuzo Fujiyama, a Tokio artist. 
    In telling these stories in English I have followed my fancy in adding  such touches of local color or description as they seemed to need or as  pleased me, and in one or two instances I have gathered in an incident  from another version. At all times, among my friends, both young and  old, English or American, I have always found eager listeners to the  beautiful legends and fairy tales of Japan, and in telling them I have  also found that they were still unknown to the vast majority, and this  has encouraged me to write them for the children of the West.
