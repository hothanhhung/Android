           Professor Macmillan has placed all lovers of fairy tales under a deep  debt of obligation to him. The fairy tale makes a universal appeal  both to old and young; to the young because it is the natural world in  which their fancy delights to range, and to the old because they are  conscious again of the spirit of youth as they read such tales to  their children and grandchildren over and over again, and rejoice in  the illusion that after all there is not a great difference of age  which separates the generations.
           The fairy tale makes this universal appeal because it deals with the  elemental in our natures that is the same in every age and in every  race. In the Canadian Tales which Professor Macmillan has so admirably  gathered from Indian sources, we find the same types of character and  scenes of adventure that we do in the tales of the German forests, of  Scandinavia, England or France.
           There is in us all an instinctive admiration for the adventurous  spirit of the fairy tale which challenges the might that is cruel and  devastating, and for the good offices of the fairies which help to  vindicate the cause of the noble in its conflict with the ignoble,  right with wrong.
           The origin of the fairy tale is to be traced always to the early  stages of civilization, and it is very gratifying to be assured from  time to time that man possesses certain natural impulses which spring  from an inherent sense of honour, and the desire to redress the wrongs  of the world.
           Professor Macmillan has been successful in presenting the Indian  folk-lore in a most engaging manner. The stories have all the  delightful charm and mystery of the Canadian forests; they have  penetrated into the heart of nature, but also into the heart of man.

           PREFACE
           The tales in this collection, like those in &quot;Canadian Wonder Tales,&quot;  were gathered in various parts of Canada&mdash;by river and lake and ocean  where sailors and fishermen still watch the stars; in forest clearings  where lumbermen yet retain some remnant of the old vanished voyageur  life and where Indians still barter for their furs; in remote country  places where women spin while they speak with reverence of their  fathers' days. The skeleton of each story has been left for the most  part unchanged, although the language naturally differs somewhat from  that of the story-tellers from whose lips the writer heard them.
           It is too often forgotten that long before the time of Arthur and his  Round Table these tales were known and treasured by the early  inhabitants of our land. However much they may have changed in the  oral passing from generation to generation the germ of the story goes  back to very early days beyond the dawn of Canadian history. Canada is  rich in this ancient lore. The effort to save it from oblivion needs  no apology. Fairy literature has an important place in the development  of the child mind, and there is no better fairy lore than that of our  own country. Through the eyes of the Indian story-teller and the  Indian dreamer, inheriting his tales from a romantic past, we can  still look through &quot;magic casements opening on the foam of perilous  seas in fairy lands forlorn&quot;; we can still feel something of the  atmosphere of that mysterious past in which our ancestors dwelt and  laboured. The author's sincerest hope in publishing this volume is  that to the children of to-day the traditions of our romantic Canadian  past will not be lost in our practical Canadian present.
