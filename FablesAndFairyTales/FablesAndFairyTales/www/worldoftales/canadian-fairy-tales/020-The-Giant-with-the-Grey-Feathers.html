          Once long ago, when the Blackfeet Indians dwelt on the Canadian  plains, there was a great famine in all the land. For many months no  buffaloes were killed, and there was no meat to be had at any price.  One by one the old people dropped off because of a lack of food, and  the young children died early because there was no nourishment, and  there was great sorrow everywhere. Only the strong women and the  stronger warriors remained alive, but even they gradually grew weaker  because of the pinch of the hunger sent into the land by famine. At  last the Chief of the tribe prayed that the Great Chieftain of the  Indians might come into his territory to tell the people what to do to  save themselves.          
          The Great Chief was at that time far away in the south country where  the warm winds were blowing and the flowers were blooming. But one  night he heard the Chief's prayer borne to him on the winds, and he  hastened northward, for he knew that his people on the plains were  somehow in dire distress. Soon he arrived at the village of the hungry  tribe. &quot;Who has called me here?&quot; he asked. &quot;It was I,&quot; answered the  Chief. &quot;My people are all starving because there are no buffaloes in  the country, and if you had not come we should soon have all  perished.&quot; Then the Great Chief looked upon his people and he noticed  that the old folks and the little children had disappeared; only a few  children were left and they had pinched cheeks and sunken eyes. And he  took pity on them and said, &quot;There is a great thief not far distant.  He is probably a wicked giant, and he has driven all the buffaloes  away. But I will find him and soon you shall have food.&quot; And the  people were all comforted, for they knew that the Great Chief would  keep his word.
          Then the Chief took with him the young Chief's son and set out on his  quest. The people wanted to go with him, but he said, &quot;No! We shall go  alone. It is a dangerous duty, and it is better that, if need be, two  should die in the attempt, than that all should perish.&quot; They  journeyed westwards across the prairies towards the Great Water in the  West, and as they went, the youth prayed to the Sun and the Moon and  the Morning Star to send them success. Soon they came to the rolling  foot-hills covered with sweet-grass and scrubby pine. But still they  saw no signs of buffalo. At last they reached a narrow stream, on the  bank of which they saw a house with smoke coming from the chimney.  &quot;There is the cause of all our troubles,&quot; said the Chief. &quot;In that  house dwells the giant Buffalo-thief and his wife. They have driven  all the animals from the prairies until not one is left. My magic  power tells me it is so!&quot; Then by his magic power he changed his  companion into a sharp-pointed straight stick, while he himself took  the shape of a dog, and they lay on the ground and waited.
          Soon the giant and his wife and their little son came along. The boy  patted the dog on the head, and said, &quot;See what a nice dog I have  found. He must be lost. May I take him home?&quot; His father said, &quot;No, I  do not like his looks. Do not touch him.&quot; The boy cried bitterly, for  he had long hoped for a dog of his own, and his mother pleaded for him  so hard that at last the giant father said, &quot;Oh, very well. Have your  own way, but no good can come of it.&quot; The woman picked up the stick  and said, &quot;I will take this nice straight stick along with me. I can  dig roots with it to make medicine.&quot; So they all went to the giant's  house, the giant frowning angrily, the woman carrying the stick, and  the boy leading the dog.
          The next morning the giant went out and soon came back with a fat  young buffalo, all skinned and ready for cooking. They roasted it on a  spit over the fire and had a good meal. The boy fed some meat to the  dog, but his father, when he saw what the boy was doing, beat him  soundly, and said, &quot;Have I not told you the dog is an evil thing? You  must not disobey me.&quot; But again the woman pleaded for her boy, and the  dog was fed. That night when all the world was asleep, the dog and the  stick changed back to their human form and had a good supper of what  was left of the buffalo-meat. And the Chief said to the youth, &quot;The  giant is the Buffalo-thief who keeps the herds from coming to the  prairies. It is useless to kill him until we have found where he has  hidden them.&quot; So they changed back to the shapes of dog and stick and  went to sleep.
          The next morning the woman and her boy set off to the forest near the  mountain, to gather berries and to dig up medicine roots. They took  the dog and the stick with them. At noon, after they had worked for  some time, they sat down to have their luncheon. The woman threw the  stick down on the ground, and the boy let the dog run away among the  shrubs. The dog wandered to the side of the mountain. There he found  an opening like the mouth of a cave. Peering into the place he saw  many buffaloes within, and he knew that at last he had found the  hiding place of the giant's plunder. He went back to the woman and the  boy and began to bark. This was the signal agreed on with his  companion. The woman and her son thought he was barking at a bird, and  they laughed at his capers as he jumped about. But he was in reality  calling to his comrade. The stick understood the call and wiggled like  a snake through the underbrush to the dog's side, unseen by the boy  and his mother. They then entered the large cave in the side of the  mountain, and there they found a great herd of buffaloes&mdash;all the  buffaloes that had been driven from the prairies. The dog barked at  them and snapped at their heels, and the stick beat them, and they  began to drive them quickly out of the cavern and eastward toward the  plains. But they still kept the shape of dog and stick. When evening  came, and it was time for the boy and his mother to go home, the boy  searched for the dog and the woman looked for her stick, but they  could not find them, and they had to go home without them.
          Just as the woman and her son reached their house on the bank of the  river, the giant-thief was coming home too. He chanced to look to the  east, and there he saw, far away, many buffaloes running towards the  foot-hills where the sweet-grass grew. He was very angry, and he cried  loudly to his son, &quot;Where is the dog? Where is the dog?&quot; &quot;I lost him  in the underbrush,&quot; said the boy; &quot;he chased a bird and did not come  back.&quot; &quot;It was not a bird he chased,&quot; said the giant; &quot;it was one of  my buffaloes. I told you he was an evil thing and not to touch him,  but you and your mother would have your way. Now my buffaloes are all  gone.&quot; He gnashed his teeth in a great rage, and rushed off to the  hidden cave to see if any buffaloes were left, crying as he went, &quot;I  will kill the dog if I find him.&quot; When he reached the cave the Chief  and the youth, still in the form of a dog and a stick, were just  rounding up the last of the buffaloes. The giant rushed at them to  kill the dog and to break the stick, but they sprang upon an old  buffalo and hid in his long hair and, clinging on tightly, the dog bit  the buffalo until the old animal plunged and roared and rushed from  the cave, bearing the Chief and the youth concealed on his back. He  galloped eastward until he reached the herd far away on the prairie,  leaving the giant far behind to make the best of his anger. Then the  Chief and the brave youth took their old form of men, and in high  spirits they drove the herd of buffaloes back to their hungry people  waiting patiently on the plains.
          The people were very pleased to see the Great Chief and the youth  returning to the village with the great herd of fat buffaloes, for  they knew now that the famine was ended. But as they drove the animals  into a great fenced enclosure, a large grey bird flew over their heads  and swooped down upon them and pecked at them with its bill, and tried  to frighten them and drive them away. The Great Chief knew by his  magic power that the grey bird was none other than the giant-thief who  had stolen the buffaloes, and who had changed himself into a bird to  fly across the prairies in pursuit of them. Then the Chief changed  himself into an otter and lay down on the bank of the stream,  pretending to be dead. The grey bird flew down upon him, for he  thought he would have a good meal of fat otter. But the Chief seized  him by the leg, and changing back to his own form, he bore him in  triumph to his camp. He tied him up fast to the smoke-hole of his tent  and made a great fire inside. The giant cried, &quot;Spare me, spare me,  and I shall never do you more harm.&quot; But the Chief left him on the  tent pole all night long while the black smoke from the fire poured  out around him. In the morning his feathers were all black. Then the  Chief let him down. And he said, &quot;You may go now, but you will never  be able to resume your former shape. You will henceforth be a raven, a  bird of ill-omen upon the earth, an outlaw and a brigand among the  birds, despised among men because of your thefts. And you will always  have to steal and to hunt hard for your food.&quot; And to this day the  feathers of the raven are black, and he is a bird of ill-omen upon the  earth because of his encounter with the Great Chieftain long ago.
