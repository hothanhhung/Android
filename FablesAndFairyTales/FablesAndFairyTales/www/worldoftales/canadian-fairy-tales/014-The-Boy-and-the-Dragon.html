          Once, long ago, before the white man came to Canada, a boy was living  with his parents in a village near the ocean. As he had no brothers or  sisters, he was often lonely, and he longed for adventure and  companionship. At last he decided to set out to seek his fortune  elsewhere. He was just on the point of leaving his home when it was  noised abroad one day that there had come into the land a great  dragon, who was doing great havoc and damage wherever he went. The  country was in great terror, for the dragon carried off women and  children and devoured them one by one. And what was still more  mystifying, he had power to take on human form, and often he changed  himself into a man of pleasing shape and manner and came among the  people to carry out his cruel designs before they knew that he was  near. The Chief of the tribe called for volunteers to meet the  dragon-man, but none of his warriors responded. They were strong and  mighty in combat with men, but it was a different matter to encounter  a dragon.
          When the youth heard this dreadful story and saw the terror of his  people, he said, &quot;Here is my chance to do a great deed,&quot; for somehow  he felt that he had more than human power. So he said good-bye to his  parents and set out on his adventure. He travelled all day inland  through the forest, until at evening he came to a high hill in the  centre of an open space. He said, &quot;I will climb this hill, and perhaps  I can see all the country round about me.&quot; So he went slowly to the  top. As he stood there, looking over the country which he could see  for many miles around, a man suddenly appeared beside him. He was a  very pleasant fellow, and they talked together for some time. The boy  was on his guard, but he thought, &quot;Surely this man with the good looks  cannot be the dragon,&quot; and he laughed at his suspicions and put them  from his mind.
          The stranger said, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; And the boy answered, &quot;I am  going far away. I am seeking adventure in the forest for it is very  lonely down by the sea.&quot; But he did not tell him of his real errand.  &quot;You may stay with me to-night,&quot; said the new-comer. &quot;I have a very  comfortable lodge not far from here, and I will give you food.&quot; The  boy was very hungry and tired, and he went along with the man to his  lodge. When they reached the house the boy was surprised to see a  great heap of bleached bones lying before the door. But he showed no  fear nor did he comment on the horrible sight. Inside the lodge sat a  very old and bent woman, tending a pot. She was stirring it with a big  stick, and the boy saw that it contained meat stew. When she placed  the stew before them, the boy said he would rather have corn, for he  feared to taste the meat. The old woman fried some corn for him, and  he had a good meal.
          After they had eaten, the man went out to gather wood for the fire,  and the boy sat talking to the old woman. And she said to him, &quot;You  are very young and beautiful and innocent&mdash;the most handsome I have  yet seen in this place. And because of that, I will take pity on you  and warn you of your danger. The man whom you met in the forest and  whom you supped with to-night is none other than the dragon-man of  whom you have often heard. He cannot be killed in ordinary combat, and  it would be folly for you to try. To-morrow he will kill you if you  are still here. Take these moccasins that I will give you, and in the  morning when you get up put them on your feet. With one step you will  reach by their power the hill you see in the distance. Give this piece  of birch bark with the picture on it to a man you will meet there, and  he will tell you what next to do. But remember that no matter how far  you go, the dragon-man will overtake you in the evening.&quot; The youth  took the moccasins and the birch bark bearing the mystic sign and hid  them under his coat, and said, &quot;I will do as you advise.&quot; But the  woman said, &quot;There is one more condition. You must kill me in the  morning before you go, and put this robe over my body. Then the  dragon-man's spell over me will be broken, and when he leaves me, I  will rouse myself with my power back to life.&quot;
          The youth went to sleep, and the dragon-man slept all night beside him  so as not to let him escape. The next morning, when the dragon-man was  out to get water from the stream some distance away, the boy at once  carried out the old woman's orders of the night before. First of all  he killed the old woman with a blow and covered her body with a bright  cloak, for he knew that when the dragon-man would leave the place she  would soon rise again. Then he put the magic moccasins on his feet and  with one great step he reached the distant hill. Here, sure enough, he  met an old man. He gave him the piece of birch bark bearing the mystic  sign. The man looked at it closely and smiled and said, &quot;So it is you  I was told to wait for. That is well, for you are indeed a comely  youth.&quot; The man gave him another pair of moccasins in exchange for  those he was wearing, and another piece of birch bark bearing another  inscription. He pointed to a hill that rose blue in the distance and  said, &quot;With one step you will reach that hill. Give this bark to a man  you will meet there, and all will be well.&quot;
          The boy put the moccasins on his feet, and with one step he reached  the distant hill. There he met another old man, to whom he gave the  birch bark. This man gave him another pair of moccasins and a large  maple leaf bearing a strange symbol, and told him to go to another  spot, where he would receive final instructions. He did as he was  told, and here he met a very old man, who said, &quot;Down yonder there is  a stream. Go towards it and walk straight into it, as if you were on  dry ground. But do not look at the water. Take this piece of birch  bark bearing these magic figures, and it will change you into whatever  you wish, and it will keep you from harm.&quot; The boy took the bark and  did as he was told, and soon found himself on the opposite bank of the  stream. He followed the stream for some distance, and at evening he  came to a lake. As he was looking about for a warm place to pass the  night, he suddenly came upon the dragon-man, now in the form of a  monster dragon, hiding behind the trees. The old woman's words had  come true, for his enemy had overtaken him before nightfall, as she  had said. There was no time to lose, so the boy waved his magic bark,  and at once he became a little fish with red fins, moving slowly in  the lake.
          When the dragon-man saw the little fish, he cried, &quot;Little fish of the  red fins, have you seen the youth I am looking for?&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; said  the little fish, &quot;I have seen no one; I have been asleep. But if he  passes this way I will tell you,&quot; and he moved rapidly out into the  lake.
          The dragon-man moved down along the bank of the lake, while the youth  watched him from the water. He met a Toad in the path, and said,  &quot;Little Toad, have you seen the youth I am looking for? If he passed  this way you would surely have seen him.&quot; &quot;I am minding my own  business,&quot; answered the Toad, and he hopped away into the moss. Then  the dragon-man saw a very large fish with his head above water,  looking for flies, and he said, &quot;Have you seen the boy I am looking  for?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said the fish, &quot;you have just been talking to him,&quot; and  he laughed to himself and disappeared. The dragon-man went back and  searched everywhere for Toad, but he could not find him. As he looked  he came upon a musk-rat running along by the stream, and he said  angrily, &quot;Have you seen the person I am looking for?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the  rat. &quot;I think you are he,&quot; said the dragon-man. Then the musk-rat  began to cry bitterly and said, &quot;No, no; the boy you are looking for  passed by just now, and he stepped on the roof of my house and broke  it in.&quot; The dragon-man was deceived again. He went on and soon came  upon old Turtle splashing around in the mud. &quot;You are very old and  wise,&quot; he said, hoping to flatter him, &quot;you have surely seen the  person I am looking for.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Turtle, &quot;he is farther down the  stream. Go across the river and you will find him. But beware, for if  you do not know him when you see him, he will surely kill you.&quot; Turtle  knew well that the dragon-man would now meet his fate.
          The dragon-man followed the lake till he came to the river. For  greater caution, so that he might be less easily seen, he changed  himself to a Snake. Then he attempted to cross the stream. But the  youth, still in the form of a fish and still using the power of his  magic bark with the mystic sign, was swimming round and round in a  circle in the middle of the river. A rapid whirlpool arose where he  swam, but it was not visible on the surface. As the Snake approached  it, he saw nothing but clear water. He failed to recognize his enemy,  and as Turtle had told him, he swam into the whirlpool before he was  aware of it, and was quickly drawn to the bottom, where he was  drowned.
          The youth fished him up and cut off his head. Then he changed back to  his own form. He went to the dragon-man's lodge to see how the old  woman had fared, but she had gone with her bright robe, and the lodge  was empty. Then the youth went back to his home and reported what he  had done. And he received many rich gifts from the Chief for his brave  deed, and the land was never troubled again by dragons. But from that  time the snake family was hated because its shape had concealed the  dragon-man, and to this day an Indian will not let a snake escape with  his life if he meets one of them in his path. For they still are  mindful of the adventure of their ancestor in the old days, and they  are suspicious of the evil power the snake family secretly possess.
