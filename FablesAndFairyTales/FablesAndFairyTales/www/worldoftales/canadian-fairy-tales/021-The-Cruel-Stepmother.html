          Once long ago, when the Blackfeet Indians dwelt on the Canadian  prairies, a poor Indian and his two children, a boy and a girl, were  living near the bank of a great river. The children's mother had long  been dead and they had long been left to the care of their father.  Their father did not think it was right that they should grow up  without a woman's kindness, and he decided at last to take another  wife. So he went far away to a distant village and there he married a  queer woman of another tribe. Soon times grew hard in the North  Country, and it was very difficult to get food. The family lived for  many days on roots and berries, and often they were very hungry  because there was no meat. Now it happened that the woman the man had  married was a very wicked witch-woman, who was capable of doing many  evil deeds. She had no love for her stepchildren, and she treated them  very cruelly. She blamed them for the lack of food in the house, and  beating them soundly, she said, &quot;You gluttonous brats; you always eat  too much. It is little wonder that we cannot keep the house supplied with food.&quot; The man saw his wife's cruelty to the children, but  although it made him sad, and at times angry, he did not interfere,  for he thought the woman should rule her home.
          One night in the early spring, as the man slept, his first wife  appeared to him in a dream, and said, &quot;Hang a large spider web across  the trail in the forest where the animals pass and you will get plenty  of food. But be good to my children. Their cruel stepmother is  planning to kill them.&quot; And she told him where to look for the magical  spider web. The next day the man found the large spider web, and he  went far away into the forest and hung it from the trees over the  trail where the animals passed. That evening when he went back to the  web he found many animals entangled in its meshes, for it had magical  power. He killed the animals and brought them home, and that night  they had a good fat supper of roast deer meat. Day after day the  magical spider web gave him great numbers of rabbits and deer, as the  vision of his dead wife had told him in the night, and from that time  on the family did not want for food.
          But the man's success in hunting only angered his witch-wife. She had  now no cause for complaint against the little children, and she could  no longer scold them and say that because of them there was no food in  the house. Her hatred for them grew stronger each day, and at last she decided to kill them and to kill their father as soon as she  could. Their father was going away on the morrow in search of wood to  make arrows for his bows, and she thought she would have a good chance  to kill them while he was gone. Then she would kill their father when  he returned. So she laid her plans. But that night the vision of his  first wife came again to the man as he slept, and it said, &quot;Your  present wife is a witch-woman. She plans to kill the children  to-morrow when you are away, and when you come home she will kill you,  too. You must kill her while there is yet time. Remember my little  children.&quot;
          When the man awoke in the morning he was much alarmed because of the  story told him by the vision of the night. He no longer trusted his  witch-wife and he decided to get rid of her. But he feared she would  attack the children before he could prevent it. So when the witch-wife  went out to get water from the stream to make breakfast, he gave each  of the children a stick, a white stone, and a bunch of soft moss, and  he said, &quot;You must run away from here and stay away until I can find  you, for you are in great danger. You will find these three things I  give you of great use. Throw them behind you if any evil thing pursues  you, and they will keep you from harm.&quot; The children in great fear at  once ran away into the forest. Then the man hung his magical spider  web over the door of the house, and sat quietly inside waiting for  his wife to come back. In a little while she came home, carrying a  pail of water, but she did not see the web with its fine strands  hanging across the door, and when she walked into it she was at once  entangled in its meshes. She struggled hard to get free, but her head  was inside the door while her body was outside, and the web held her  fast around the neck. Then the man said, &quot;I know now that you are a  cruel witch-woman. You will beat my children no more.&quot; With his  stone-axe he struck her a mighty blow which completely severed her  head from her body. Then he ran from the house as fast as he could and  went towards his children, who were watching him not far away.
          But the man was not yet done with the cruel witch-woman. As he ran  from the house her headless body, freed from the spider web, ran after  him, while her severed head, with eyes staring and hair flying,  followed the children, sometimes bumping along the ground and  sometimes rising through the air. The father thought it would be well  to go in a different direction from the children, and he went west,  while they went east. The children were very frightened when they saw  the horrible head behind them, slowly gaining upon them. Then they  remembered their father's magic gifts. When the head was close upon  them, they threw their sticks on the ground at their backs and at once  a dense forest sprang up between them and their pursuer. The children  said, &quot;Now we will rest here for a while, for we are nearly out of  breath. The wicked head cannot get through that dense forest.&quot; And  they sat on the grass and rested.
          Soon, however, the pursuing head emerged from the thick trees. The  children got up and ran as hard as they could, but close behind them  came the severed head, rolling its eyes and gnashing its teeth in a  great frenzy, and uttering terrible yells. It was very near to them,  when the children again remembered their father's gifts. They threw  the white stones behind them, and at once a high mountain of white  rock rose between them and their enemy. They sat on the ground and  rested, and said, &quot;Oh dear, oh dear, what shall we do? We have only  one means of safety left, these little bits of moss.&quot; The wicked head  hurled itself against the mountain, but it could not get through. A  big buffalo bull was feeding on the grass near it, and the head called  to him to break a road through the mountain. The bull rushed at the  mountain with all his force, but the mountain was so hard that it  broke his head and he fell down dead. Some moles were playing in the  soft earth near by, and the head called to them to make a passage  through the hill. So the moles searched and found a soft earthy place  in the midst of the rock and soon they tunnelled a hole to the other  side of the mountain, through which the head was able to pass. When  the children saw their pursuer coming out of the moles' tunnel they  cried loudly and ran away as fast as they could. At last, after a very  long chase, the head was almost upon them, and they decided to use  their last means of protection. They threw the wet moss behind them,  and at once a long black swamp appeared where the moss had fallen,  between them and their wicked follower. The head was going at such a  great speed, bumping over the ground, that it could not stop. It  rolled into the swamp and disappeared into the soft mud and was never  seen again.
          The children then went home to wait for their father. It was a long  journey, for they had run far. But their father never came. Months and  months they waited, but he did not come, and they grew up to be great  magicians and very powerful among their tribe. At last, by their magic  power, they learned what had happened to their father. Their  stepmother's body continued to follow him as he ran towards the west.  It followed him for many days. Then by his magic power, which the  vision of his dead wife had brought to him, he changed himself into  the Sun, and went to live with his wife in the sky-country. But the  old witch-woman also had magic power, and she changed herself into the  Moon and followed him to the land of the stars. And there she still  pursues him. And while he keeps ahead of her and she cannot catch him,  night follows day in all the world. But if she overtakes him she will  kill him, and day will disappear and night shall reign for evermore  upon the earth. And the Blackfeet of the plains pray that he will  always keep in front in the race with his former witch-wife, so that  there may be always Night and Day in succession in all the land.
