          Once, long ago, Rabbit lived with his old grandmother deep in the  Canadian forest, far from all other people. He was a great hunter, and  all around, far and near, he laid snares and set traps to catch game  for food. It was winter, and he caught many little animals and birds.  He brought them home daily to feed himself and his old grandmother,  and he was well pleased with his success. But after some weeks had  passed he was unable to catch any game. He always found his traps and  snares empty, although many tracks were always around them, and there  were many signs that animals were prowling about. He knew then that he  was being robbed nightly, and that a thief was pilfering his traps. It  was very cold and the snow lay deep in the forest, and Rabbit and his  old grandmother were in dire need of food. Every morning Rabbit rose  very early and hurried off to his traps, but always he found them  empty, for the thief had been ahead of him. He was greatly puzzled,  for he could not think who the thief was.
          At last one morning, after a new fall of snow, he found the mark of a  long foot near his traps, and he knew it was the foot of the  game-robber. It was the longest foot-print he had ever seen, long and  narrow and very light, like a moonbeam. And Rabbit said, &quot;Now I shall  rise earlier in the morning, and I shall go to my traps ahead of the  thief and take my game, so that they will all be empty when he comes.&quot;  Each morning he rose earlier to catch the thief, but the man of the  long foot was always there before him, and his game was always gone.  No matter how early Rabbit got up, the thief was always ahead of him  and his traps were always empty.
          So Rabbit said to his old grandmother, &quot;The man of the long foot, who  robs my traps, is always up ahead of me, no matter how early I rise. I  will make a snare from a bow-string, and I will watch all this night,  and I will surely catch him.&quot; He made a trap from a stout bow-string  and set it beside his snares, and took the end of the bow-string some  distance away to a clump of trees, behind which he hid. He hoped that  the thief would step into the trap; then he would pull the bow-string  and tie him fast to a tree. He sat very quiet, waiting for the man of  the long foot to appear. It was moonlight when he set out, but soon it  grew very dark in the forest. The Moon suddenly disappeared. But the  stars were all shining on the white snow and there were no clouds in  the sky, and Rabbit wondered what had happened to the Moon. He waited  very still and a little frightened in the starlight.
          Soon he heard some one coming, sneaking stealthily through the trees.  Then he saw a white light which dazzled his eyes. The light went  towards the snares, until it stopped just at the trap Rabbit had set.  Then Rabbit pulled the bow-string, closed the trap as he had hoped,  and tied the string fast to a tree. He heard sounds of a struggle, and  he saw the white light move from side to side, but he knew that he had  his prisoner fast and that the man of the long foot was caught at  last. He was much afraid of the white light, and he ran home as fast  as he could and told his old grandmother that he had caught the  game-robber in the trap, and that he did not know who he was, for he  was too frightened to look. And his grandmother said, &quot;You must go  back and see who it is, and tell him he must stop robbing your  snares.&quot; But Rabbit said, &quot;I do not want to go until daylight, for the  Moon has gone down and the forest is very dark.&quot; But his grandmother  said, &quot;You must go.&quot; So poor Rabbit, although he was very frightened  by what he had seen, set out again for his traps.
          When he drew near to his snares he saw that the white light was still  shining. It was so bright that his eyes were dazzled and he had to  stop far from it. Then he approached nearer, but his eyes soon became  very sore. There was a stream flowing beside him, and he bathed his  eyes in the cold water, but it brought him no relief, and his eyes  felt hot and red, and tears fell from them because of the dazzling  light. Then he took great handfuls of snow and threw snowballs at the  light, hoping thereby to put it out. But when the snowballs came near  to the light they melted and fell down like rain. Then, with his eyes  still smarting, Rabbit in his rage scooped up great handfuls of soft  black mud from the bottom of the stream, and forming it into balls, he  threw them with all his force at the white light. He heard them strike  something with a dull thud, and he heard loud yells from the  prisoner&mdash;the man of the long foot&mdash;behind the shining light. Then a  voice came from the light, saying, &quot;Why did you snare me? Come and  untie me at once. I am the Man in the Moon. It is near to the morning,  and before dawn I must be on my way home. You have already spotted my  face with mud, and if you do not loose me at once I shall kill all  your tribe.&quot;
          Poor Rabbit was more frightened than before, and he ran home and told  his old grandmother what had happened. And his grandmother was also  very frightened, for she thought that no good could come of it. And  she told Rabbit to go back at once and untie the Man in the Moon, for  the night was almost spent, and the dawn would soon be breaking. So  poor Rabbit, trembling in his fear, went back to his traps. From a  great distance he cried, &quot;I will untie you if you will never again rob  my snares, and if you will never come back to earth.&quot; And the prisoner  in the trap promised, and said, &quot;I swear it by my white light.&quot; Then  Rabbit approached very carefully. He had to shut his eyes and grope  his way because of the bright light, and his lip quivered because of  the great heat. At last he rushed in and cut the bow-string snare with  his teeth, and the Man in the Moon hurried on his way, for he could  already see the dawn in the East. But Rabbit was almost blinded while  he was about it, and his shoulders were badly scorched. And ever since  that time Rabbit blinks and his eyelids are pink, and water runs from  his eyes when he looks at a bright light; and his lip always quivers;  and his shoulders are yellow, even when he wears his white winter  coat, because of the great light and heat on the winter night long ago  when he loosed the Man in the Moon from the snare. And since that  night the Man in the Moon has never come back to earth. He stays at  his task in the sky, lighting the forest by night; but he still bears  on his face the marks of the black mud which Rabbit threw at him. And  sometimes for several nights he goes away to a quiet place, where he  tries to wash off the mud; and then the land is dark. But he never  succeeds in cleaning himself, and when he comes back to his work the  marks of Rabbit's mud-balls are still upon his shining face.
