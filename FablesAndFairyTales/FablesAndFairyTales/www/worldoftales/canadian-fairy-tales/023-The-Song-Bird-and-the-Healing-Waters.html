          Once when the snow lay very deep on the ground and the days were grey  with frost, there was great sorrow in an Indian village. A dreadful  plague had come upon the place and had carried away many of the  people. Neither old nor young were proof against its ravages, and the  weak and the strong fell helpless before its power. The people tried  every means to get rid of the plague, but they had no success. And  they prayed to all their good spirits to help them, but no help came.  In the tribe was a young warrior who had lost his parents and all his  brothers and sisters because of the dreaded disease. Now his young  wife fell sick, and he was in great sorrow, for he thought that she  would soon follow his parents into the Land of the Shadows. And so he  went about in great fear, not knowing when the end would come.
          One day he met an old woman in the forest. &quot;Why do you look so  sorrowful?&quot; she asked him. &quot;I am sad because my young wife is going to  die,&quot; he answered; &quot;the plague will carry her off like the others.&quot;  But the old woman said, &quot;There is something that will save your wife  from death. Far away in the East is a bird of sweet song which dwells  close to the Healing Waters. Go until you find it. It will point you  to the spring, the waters of which alone can heal.&quot; And the young man  said, &quot;I must find the Healing Waters. Wherever they may be upon the  earth, I must find them.&quot; So he went home and said good-bye to his  friends, and set out eastward on his quest.
          All the next day he searched eagerly for the Waters, listening always  for the bird of the sweet song. But he found nothing. The snow lay  deep in the forest and he moved along with difficulty. He met a rabbit  in his path and he said, &quot;Tell me where I shall find the Healing  Spring?&quot; But the rabbit scurried away over the snow and made no  answer. Then he asked a bear, but he met with the same rebuff. Thus  for many days and nights he wandered on, crossing rivers and climbing  steep hills, but always without success.
          Then one day he emerged from the snow country and came to a land where  the airs were warmer and where little streams were flowing. Suddenly  he came upon the body of a dead man lying across his path. He stopped  and buried the body, for he thought that it was not right to leave it  lying bare upon the ground for the birds to peck at. That night as he  went along in the moonlight he met a Fox in his path. &quot;Hello,&quot; said  the Fox. &quot;What are you looking for so late at night in the forest?&quot;  And he answered, &quot;I am looking for the bird of the sweet song, who  will show me the way to the Healing Waters.&quot; And the Fox said, &quot;I am  the spirit of the man you buried yesterday by the forest path, and in  return for your kindness to me I shall do a kindness to you. You have  always been good to the animals and the birds, and you have never  killed them needlessly, nor when you did not require them for clothing  or for food. And you have always been careful of the flowers and the  trees, and you have often protected them from harm. So now they want  to be good to you, and I am going to guide you. But first you must  rest, for you are tired from your long journey.&quot;
          Then the young man lay down to sleep and the Fox stood guard beside  him. As he slept he dreamed. And in his dream he saw his wife pale and  thin and worn, and as he looked he heard her singing a song of  wonderful melody. Then he heard a waterfall rippling near him and it  said, &quot;Seek me, O warrior, and when you find me your wife shall live,  for I am the Healing Waters.&quot; In the morning the Fox led him but a  short distance through the forest and on the branch of a tree he heard  a bird singing a song of wonderful melody, just as he had heard in his  dream of the night before. He knew now that this was the bird of the  sweet song of which the old woman in the forest had spoken. Then, as  he listened, he heard the sound of a waterfall rippling not far away.  He searched for it, but he could not find it. And Fox said, &quot;You must  seek it; you must not despair; it will not come to you unless you  search.&quot; So he searched again, and soon he thought he heard a voice  speaking beneath his feet. &quot;Release us,&quot; it called, &quot;set us free and  your wife and your people shall be saved.&quot; He seized a sharp stick and  dug rapidly into the earth where he had heard the voice. He worked  eagerly and quickly, and he had not dug far when the spring gushed  forth and boiled upwards carrying to the world its healing power. And  the young man knew that at last he had found the cure for his ills. He  plunged into the spring and bathed himself in the water, and all his  weariness left him and he was strong again.
          Then the young man moulded from the soft earth a large pot. He baked  it in the fire until it was quite hard. &quot;Now,&quot; said the Fox spirit, &quot;I  will leave you. Your kindness has been rewarded. You will need me no  more, for you have found the Healing Waters.&quot; And he disappeared as  mysteriously as he had come. The young man filled his clay pot with  the sparkling water and hastened back to his home, running through the  forest with the speed of the wind, because of his renewed strength.
          When he reached his native village, the people met him with sad faces,  for the plague was still raging and they told him that his young wife  was about to pass to the Land of the Shadows. But he hurried to his  home, and he forced some of the Healing Waters between his wife's  parched lips, and bathed her hands and her brow until she fell into a  deep slumber. He watched by her side until she awoke, and when sleep  left her she was well again. Then with his Healing Waters he cured all  the people in the village, and the cruel plague left them and there  was no more sickness in the land. And since that time no plague has  spread among his tribe. In this way the Mineral Springs, the places of  Healing Waters, came upon the earth, bearing health and happiness  wherever they rise, and accompanied always by the songs of birds.
