          Long ago there dwelt on the shores of the Great Water in the west a  young man and his younger wife. They had no children and they lived  all by themselves far from other people on an island not far from the  coast. The man spent his time in catching the deep-sea fish far out on  the ocean, or in spearing salmon in the distant rivers. Often he was  gone for many days and his wife was very lonely in his absence. She  was not afraid, for she had a stout spirit, but it was very dismal in  the evenings to look only at the grey leaden sky and to hear only the  sound of the surf as it beat upon the beach. So day after day she said  to herself, &quot;I wish we had children. They would be good company for me  when I am alone and my husband is far away.&quot;
          One evening at twilight when she was solitary because of her husband's  absence on the ocean catching the deep-sea fish, she sat on the sand  beach looking out across the water. The sky in the west was pale grey;  it was always dull and grey in that country, and when the sun had gone  down there was no soft light. In her loneliness the woman said to  herself, &quot;I wish we had children to keep me company.&quot; A Kingfisher,  with his children, was diving for minnows not far away. And the woman  said, &quot;Oh, sea bird with the white collar, I wish we had children like  you.&quot; And the Kingfisher said, &quot;Look in the sea-shells; look in the  sea-shells,&quot; and flew away. The next evening the woman sat again upon  the beach looking westward at the dull grey sky. Not far away a white  Sea-gull was riding on the waves in the midst of her brood of little  ones. And the woman said, &quot;Oh, white sea bird, I wish we had children  like you to keep us company.&quot; And the Sea-gull said, &quot;Look in the  sea-shells; look in the sea-shells,&quot; and flew away.
          The woman wondered greatly at the words of the Kingfisher and the  Sea-Gull. As she sat there in thought she heard a strange cry coming  from the sand dunes behind her. She went closer to the sound and found  that the cry came from a large sea-shell lying on the sand. She picked  up the shell, and inside of it was a tiny boy, crying as hard as he  could. She was well pleased with her discovery, and she carried the  baby to her home and cared for him. When her husband came home from  the sea, he, too, was very happy to find the baby there, for he knew  that they would be lonely no more.
          The baby grew very rapidly, and soon he was able to walk and move  about where he pleased. One day the woman was wearing a copper  bracelet on her arm and the child said to her, &quot;I must have a bow  made from the copper on your arm.&quot; So to please him she made him a  tiny bow from the bracelet, and two tiny arrows. At once he set out to  hunt game, and day after day he came home bearing the products of his  chase. He brought home geese and ducks and brant and small sea birds,  and gave them to his mother for food. As he grew older the man and his  wife noticed that his face took on a golden hue brighter than the  colour of his copper bow. Wherever he went there was a strange light.  When he sat on the beach looking to the west the weather was always  calm and there were strange bright gleams upon the water. And his  foster-parents wondered greatly at this unusual power. But the boy  would not talk about it; when they spoke of it he was always silent.
          It happened once that the winds blew hard over the Great Water and the  man could not go out to catch fish because of the turbulent sea. For  many days he stayed on shore, for the ocean, which was usually at  peace, was lashed into a great fury and the waves were dashing high on  the beach. Soon the people were in need of fish for food. And the boy  said, &quot;I will go out with you, for I can overcome the Storm Spirit.&quot;  The man did not want to go, but at last he listened to the boy's  entreaties and together they set out for the fishing grounds far  across the tossing sea. They had not gone far when they met the Spirit  of the Storm coming madly from the south-west where the great winds  dwelt. He tried hard to upset their boat, but over them he had no  power, for the boy guided the frail craft across the water and all  around them the sea was calm and still. Then the Storm Spirit called  his nephew Black Cloud to help him, and away in the south-east they  saw him hurrying to his uncle's aid. But the boy said to the man, &quot;Be  not afraid, for I am more than a match for him.&quot; So the two met, but  when Black Cloud saw the boy he quickly disappeared. Then the Spirit  of the Storm called Mist of the Sea to come and cover the water, for  he thought the boat would be lost if he hid the land from the man and  the boy. When the man saw Mist of the Sea coming like a grey vapour  across the water he was very frightened, for of all his enemies on the  ocean he feared this one most. But the boy said, &quot;He cannot harm you  when I am with you.&quot; And sure enough, when Mist of the Sea saw the boy  sitting smiling in the boat he disappeared as quickly as he had come.  And the Storm Spirit in great anger hurried away to other parts, and  that day there was no more danger on the sea near the fishing grounds.
          The boy and the man soon reached the fishing grounds in safety. And  the boy taught his foster-father a magic song with which he was able  to lure fish to his nets. Before evening came the boat was filled with  good fat fish and they set out for their home. The man said, &quot;Tell me  the secret of your power.&quot; But the boy said, &quot;It is not yet time.&quot;
          The next day the boy killed many birds. He skinned them all and dried  their skins. Then he dressed himself in the skin of a plover and rose  into the air and flew above the sea. And the sea under him was grey  like his wings. Then he came down and dressed himself in the skin of a  blue-jay and soared away again. And the sea over which he was flying  was at once changed to blue like the blue of his wings. When he came  back to the beach, he put on the skin of a robin with the breast of a  golden hue like his face. Then he flew high and at once the waves  under him reflected a colour as of fire and bright gleams of light  appeared upon the ocean, and the sky in the west was golden red. The  boy flew back to the beach and he said to his foster-parents, &quot;Now it  is time for me to leave you. I am the offspring of the sun. Yesterday  my power was tested and it was not found wanting, so now I must go  away and I shall see you no more. But at evening I shall appear to you  often in the twilight sky in the west. And when the sky and the sea  look at evening like the colour of my face, you will know that there  will be no wind nor storm and that on the morrow the weather will be  fair. But although I go away, I shall leave you a strange power. And  always when you need me, let me know your desires by making white  offerings to me, so that I may see them from my home far in the west.&quot;
          Then he gave to his foster-mother a wonderful robe. He bade his  parents good-bye, and soared away to the west, leaving them in  sadness. But the woman still keeps a part of the power he gave her,  and when she sits on the island in a crevice in the dunes and loosens  her wonderful robe, the wind hurries down from the land, and the sea  is ruffled with storm; and the more she loosens the garment the  greater is the tempest. But in the late autumn when the cold mists  come in from the sea, and the evenings are chill, and the sky is dull  and grey, she remembers the promise of the boy. And she makes to him  an offering of tiny white feathers plucked from the breasts of birds.  She throws them into the air, and they appear as flakes of snow and  rise thickly into the winds. And they hurry westward to tell the boy  that the world is grey and dreary as it yearns for the sight of his  golden face. Then he appears to the people of earth. He comes at  evening and lingers after the sun has gone, until the twilight sky is  red, and the ocean in the west has gleams of golden light. And the  people then know that there will be no wind and that on the morrow the  weather will be fair, as he promised them long ago.
