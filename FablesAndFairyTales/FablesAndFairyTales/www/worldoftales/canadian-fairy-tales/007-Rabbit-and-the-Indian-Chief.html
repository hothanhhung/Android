          Long ago an Indian Chief was living with his people far in the  Canadian forest. Life was good and food was plentiful and the people  were all very happy. But one day a wicked giant and his old witch wife  came crashing into the land from a far country beyond the prairies.  They devoured all the food they could lay their hands on and soon  there was little left to eat in all the country; and often they  carried off little children to their hiding-place and ate them up  until not a trace of them remained. Somewhere far in the forest they  dwelt in a hidden cave; they slept all day long, but at night they  always stalked forth in search of plunder. The Chief was much  troubled, and with his warriors he tried in every way to discover  their hiding-place, but no one ever succeeded in finding it. For by  the use of their magic power the giant and his old witch wife could  make themselves invisible when they walked abroad among men and they  could not be caught. The Chief called all his warriors to a council,  and he said, &quot;Who can rid me of this pest? Who can kill the giant?&quot;  But not a man replied. And when he saw his people's store of food rapidly growing smaller and the little children of his tribe slowly  disappearing, he was greatly puzzled as to what he should do.
          One night of bright moonlight Rabbit was prowling through the woods,  as was his custom, in search of some one on whom he could play a  prank, for he was a great joker. Suddenly he came upon the giant and  his old witch wife standing by an opening in the side of a low  mountain. He watched them for a long time from the shadow of a great  tree, and at last he saw them enter a large hole in the side of the  hill. He knew now that he had hit by accident upon the giant's cave  and he was well pleased by his discovery. But he kept his secret to  himself, for he thought, &quot;Here is a good chance for me to win fame. I  will kill the giants by a crafty trick and I will then be looked upon  as a great warrior, the foremost in all the land, for all the Chief's  men have failed to find the giants.&quot;
          So he went to the Chief and said, &quot;Oh, Chief, I know where the giants  live and I swear to you that I am going to kill them. It is I alone  who can rid you of these pests.&quot; &quot;You!&quot; said the Chief in great  surprise; &quot;little harm the like of you can do to giants; they will eat  you up in one mouthful,&quot; and he laughed loudly at Rabbit's boldness.  And he called to his warriors saying, &quot;See what a stout fighter we  have here! Little Rabbit says he can do what we have failed to do; he  swears that he will kill the giants; he is better fitted to kill a  mouse!&quot; And they all laughed loud haw-haws at Rabbit's vanity.
          Poor Rabbit's pride was deeply hurt by the Chief's scorn and the  warriors' cruel laughter, but it all made him more determined than  ever to slay the thieving giants. So he went to an old woman who lived  near-by and said, &quot;Give me an old faded dress and a ragged old shawl  and your coloured spectacles and a hat with a feather in it.&quot; The old  woman wondered what tricks he was up to now, but she gave him what he  asked for. He put on the tattered old dress and the battered old hat  with a red feather sticking from the top, and he wrapped the old shawl  about his face, and he wore the woman's coloured spectacles and he  carried a crooked stick. And dressed in this fashion he set out  towards evening for the giants' home. When he reached the mouth of the  cave, he stood still and waited, leaning on his crooked stick, for  night was coming on and he knew that the giants would soon be going  out on their plundering rounds.
          After a time when it was quite dark except for the moonlight, the  giant's old witch wife came out of the cave. When she saw Rabbit in  the dim light she said gruffly, &quot;Who are you, standing there in the  shadows?&quot; &quot;Oh, my dear niece,&quot; said Rabbit, &quot;I have found you at last.  I am your poor old aunt. I thought I had lost my way. I have come to  see you from your home in the far country. It was a long journey and  my poor old legs and back are stiff and sore, and I am very hungry and  tired;&quot; and he moved slowly towards the woman, hobbling along with his  crooked stick. The giant woman was deceived, and she threw her arms  around Rabbit and kissed him, and she did not feel his whiskers or his  split lip because of the old shawl that was wrapped around his face.  &quot;I have a pain in my jaw from sleeping out of doors,&quot; said Rabbit,  &quot;and I must keep my face wrapped up.&quot;
          &quot;Come in and rest, and you will soon feel better,&quot; said the giant  woman.
          &quot;You will have to lead me in,&quot; said Rabbit, not wishing to take off  the shawl, &quot;for my eyesight is very bad.&quot;
          So she led Rabbit into the warm cave, which was so dark that they  could scarcely see each other, and she called her husband and said,  &quot;Here is my dear old aunt who has come all the way from the far  country beyond the prairies.&quot; And the giant, believing Rabbit to be  his wife's kindred, for he could not see him very clearly, treated him  very kindly. And they showed him the bed where he was to sleep.
          The woman then gave Rabbit a large piece of dried meat to eat. But  Rabbit said, &quot;I cannot eat it, for I am old and I have lost all my  teeth. Give me an axe to cut it up small.&quot; So the woman brought him a  sharp axe and he chopped the meat into small pieces and ate it all up.  And he said, &quot;I will keep the axe by me, for I shall need it at all my  meals,&quot; and he placed it beside his bed. The giant said, &quot;We are  going away to see some friends, but we shall be back before midnight.&quot;  But before they went away Rabbit said to the woman, &quot;I hope your  husband sleeps soundly; I have a bad cough and I sometimes moan  because of the pain in my face and head and I do not wish to disturb  him.&quot;
          And the old giant woman answered, &quot;He slumbers too well. When we sleep  we both snore loudly, and when you hear us snoring you may cough as  much as you please, for then you will know that we are sound asleep.&quot;  Then the man and his witch wife went away.
          When the giants came home, Rabbit pretended to be fast asleep. They  brought back with them much food which they hid in a secret place at  the side of the cave. Rabbit watched them through the holes in the old  shawl around his head. Soon they went to bed, drowsy after their fat  meal. When Rabbit heard them snoring loudly like a great waterfall,  &quot;chr-r-r, chr-r-r,&quot; he arose very quietly and crept softly to their  bedside. With two blows of his axe he killed the giant and his wife,  one after the other. Then he ran away as fast as he could, carrying  with him his old dress and hat and shawl, for he thought he might need  them again.
          In the morning he went to the Chief's house and told the Chief what he  had done. The Chief laughed scornfully and he would not believe it  until Rabbit brought him to the cave and showed him the slain giants  cold and stiff in their bed. The Chief's men then took back to the  village the great store of food the giants had hidden in the secret  place. But the Chief and his warriors, although they were glad to be  rid of the thieves, were angry at heart because Rabbit whom they had  laughed at had done what they had failed to do, for they were very  jealous of Rabbit's power.
          One day soon afterwards the Chief called all the birds and the animals  to a council, and he said, &quot;Now that the giants who robbed us of our  food are dead and gone, and that we shall never again want for  nourishment in my country, I am going to let each animal and bird  choose the kind of food he would most like to live on if he could get  it. And they shall never want for that kind of food if it can be  provided.&quot; And he called on each to make the choice. And the birds  said &quot;Grain and seeds and worms,&quot; and the Squirrel said &quot;Nuts,&quot; and  the Fox said &quot;Chickens,&quot; and the cat said &quot;Milk,&quot; and the dog said  &quot;Meat and bones,&quot; and the weasel said &quot;Eggs,&quot; and the wolf said  &quot;Lambs,&quot; and the bear said &quot;Fish from the frozen sea,&quot; and so on until  each animal was called upon and declared his liking. And the Chief  said, &quot;It shall be as you have chosen.&quot; But the Chief had purposely  neglected to summon poor Rabbit to the council, and Rabbit was absent  on a long journey. When he came home, he was very angry when he heard  what had happened, for only the left-over in the world's food remained  for him to choose. So he went to the Chief and said in great wrath,  &quot;This is a fine return for ridding your land of giants. But that is a  way you have; you always reward good deeds with evil.&quot;
          The Chief was very angry because of Rabbit's insolence, and he said,  &quot;You are telling lies again.&quot; But Rabbit called as witnesses to the  truth of what he said Sheep and Goat and Duck who chanced to be  passing by and who stood listening to the quarrel. And old Sheep said,  &quot;Rabbit has spoken truly. When I was young I gave the Chief much wool  to make clothes for his back and he used me well. But now that I am  old he is going to kill me and eat me up. That is my reward.&quot; And old  Goat said, &quot;Rabbit has spoken wisely and justly. I served the Chief  well in my time and gave him milk, but now that I am old and have no  more milk he is fattening me and getting me ready for slaughter. That  is my reward.&quot; And old Duck said, &quot;That is a true saying of Rabbit.  Once upon a time I gave the Chief many eggs and young ducklings, but  now that I have stopped laying he is soon going to roast me in a pot.  That is my reward.&quot; The Chief could make no answer to these charges,  for he knew them to be true, and he offered to do what was in his  power for Rabbit. But Rabbit refused to make choice of food, for he  said the best was already gone. He sulked for many months and lived  alone by his own efforts as best he could.
          At last he decided to take vengeance on the Chief. And he hit, as was  his custom, on a crafty trick. The Chief had an old Bear which he  prized very highly, for the Bear did for him many wondrous tricks and  brought laughter to him and his warriors when he danced at their  feasts. In those olden times Bear had a long bushy tail of which he  was very proud. One day as Rabbit sat on the ice fishing&mdash;for it was  now winter&mdash;Bear came along. There was to be a feast that night and he  was going to dance for the Chief, and he was in very good spirits.  &quot;Where did you get all the fine fish?&quot; he asked, for he was a great  fish eater. &quot;I caught them through the hole in the ice,&quot; said Rabbit.  &quot;It is very easy. Just drop your tail down through the hole and it  will soon be covered with fine big fish.&quot;
          Bear did as he was told, and he sat on the ice for a long time waiting  for his prey. He sat so long that the hole froze up, for it was very  cold, and in it was frozen poor Bear's long bushy tail. &quot;Now,&quot; said  Rabbit, &quot;jump quick, for many fish are hanging to you.&quot; Bear jumped  with all his might, but his tail was held fast in the ice and it broke  off close to the root. Rabbit laughed in great glee and ran away. And  poor Bear howled with pain and shame. He could not dance at the feast  because his stub of a tail was sore, and the Chief and the warriors  were very angry at Rabbit because he had harmed their dancing pet. And  since that time Bear has had a short stubby tail which to this day he  tries to wag feebly.
          Rabbit then hid for some days far from the Chief and his warriors.  Then he decided to try another trick. The Chief's wood-cutter was old  Beaver, who lived in a little house of reeds on the bank of a stream.  He was very busy now cutting down trees for the Chief, for it was near  to spring-time and the people were in need of logs for building roads  over the rivers. One day Rabbit went to Beaver and said, &quot;The Chief  sent me to you to bring you to a great tree he wishes you to cut down  at once.&quot; So Beaver went along with him. But when Beaver was busy at  his task cutting down the tree, Rabbit hit him a savage blow on the  head with a big stick hoping to kill him and thus again to anger the  Chief. Poor Beaver fell to the ground and Rabbit ran away. But Beaver  was only stunned. He got up after a time and went home muttering to  himself and rubbing his sore head. Soon Rabbit came back to the tree  and found Beaver gone. He knew that his blow had failed. Then he put  on again his tattered old dress and his ragged shawl and his coloured  spectacles and the hat with the red feather sticking to the top, and  he went to Beaver's house by the stream, hobbling along with a stick.  &quot;The Chief sent me to you to bring you to a great tree he wishes you  to cut down at once,&quot; he called. And Beaver said, &quot;I have already  tried to cut a great tree for him to-day and I should have finished it  had I not been beaten with a stick until I was stunned by the blow.&quot;  &quot;Who struck you?&quot; asked Rabbit, laughing to himself. &quot;Rabbit struck  me,&quot; answered Beaver. &quot;He is a great brigand and a liar and a thief,&quot;  said Rabbit. &quot;He is all that,&quot; said Beaver, rubbing the lump on his  head. So Beaver went along with Rabbit. And Rabbit asked as they went  along, &quot;How is it that you are alive after that cruel blow?&quot; And  Beaver said, &quot;Rabbit hit me on the head. If he had hit me on the back  of my neck he would have killed me, for there I keep the secret of my  life.&quot;
          When Beaver was busy again at his task cutting down the tree, Rabbit  hit him a powerful blow on the back of the neck and poor Beaver fell  down dead. Then he cut off his tail that was made like a file, and  went away happy, for he knew that the Chief would be very angry when  he found what had happened to his wood-cutter.
          When the Chief learned that Beaver had been killed, his wrath knew no  bounds, for he could ill afford at this time to lose his best  wood-chopper. He blamed Rabbit for the deed, but he could not be sure  that his suspicions were well-founded. Rabbit kept out of the Chief's  sight for some weeks. But one day in early summer he was very hungry.  He saw all the other animals filling their bellies with their  favourite food, and he decided to forget his sulks and to ask the  Chief for help. So he went to the Chief and said haughtily, &quot;I want  you to give me food for my own special use as you have done with the  other animals. You must do it at once or I will do you much harm.&quot;  Then the Chief remembered what Rabbit had done to his dancing Bear,  and he thought of the death of Beaver, for which he blamed Rabbit  without proof, and he grew red with anger. He seized Rabbit by the  heels and said, &quot;Henceforth the dogs will always chase you, and you  will never have peace when they are near. And you will live for the  most part on whatever food I throw you into now.&quot; Then he whirled  Rabbit around his head by the heels, and he threw him from him with  great force, hoping to drop him in a great black swamp near-by. Poor  Rabbit went flying through the air for a great distance, farther than  the Chief had hoped, and he dropped with a thud into a field of clover  on the edge of which cabbages and lettuce were growing. And since that  time the dogs have always chased Rabbit and he has lived for the most  part on cabbages and lettuce and clover which he steals on moonlight  nights from farmers' fields.
