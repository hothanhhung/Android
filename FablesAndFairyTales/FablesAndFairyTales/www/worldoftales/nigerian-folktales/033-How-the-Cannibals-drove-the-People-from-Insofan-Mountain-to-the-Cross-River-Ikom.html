Abragba and Enfitop also lived there, and were also under King Agbor.  The Insofan Mountain is about two days' march inland from the Cross  River, and as none of the people there could swim, and knew nothing  about canoes, they never went anywhere outside their own country, and  were afraid to go down to the big river. The whole country was taken  up with yam farms, and was divided amongst the various towns, each  town having its own bush. At the end of each year, when it was time to  dig the yams, there was a big play held, which was called the New Yam  feast. At this festival there was always a big human sacrifice, fifty  slaves being killed in one day. These slaves were tied up to trees in  a row, and many drums were beaten; then a strong man, armed with a  sharp matchet, went from one slave to another and cut their heads off.  This was done to cool the new yams, so that they would not hurt the  stomachs of the people. Until this sacrifice was made no one in the  country would eat a new yam, as they knew, if they did so, they would  suffer great pain in their insides.
                  When the feast was held, all the towns brought one hundred yams each  as a present to King Agbor. When the slaves were all killed fires were  lit, and the dead bodies were placed over the fires to burn the hair  off. A number of plantain leaves were then gathered and placed on the  ground, and the bodies, having been cut into pieces, were placed on  the plantain leaves.
                  When the yams were skinned, they were put into large pots, with water,  oil, pepper, and salt. The cut-up bodies were then put in on top, and  the pots covered up with other clay pots and left to boil for an hour.
                  The king, having called all the people together, then declared the New  Yam feast had commenced, and singing and dancing were kept up for  three days and nights, during which time much palm wine was consumed,  and all the bodies and yams, which had been provided for them, were  eaten by the people.
                  The heads were given to the king for his share, and, when he had  finished eating them, the skulls were placed before the Ju Ju with  some new yams, so that there should be a good crop the following  season.
                  But although these natives ate the dead bodies of the slaves at the  New Yam feast, they did not eat human flesh during the rest of the  year.
                  This went on for many years, until at last the Okuni people noticed  that the graves of the people who had been buried were frequently dug  open and the bodies removed. This caused great wonder, and, as they  did not like the idea of their dead relations being taken away, they  made a complaint to King Agbor. He at once caused a watch to be set on  all newly dug graves, and that very night they caught seven men, who  were very greedy, and used to come whenever a body was buried, dig it  up, and carry it into the bush, where they made a fire, and cooked and  ate it.
                  When they were caught, the people made them show where they lived, and  where they cooked the bodies.
                  After walking for some hours in the forest, they came to a place where  large heaps of human bones and skulls were found.
                  The seven men were then securely fastened up and brought before King  Agbor, who held a large palaver of all the towns, and the whole  situation was discussed.
                  Agbor said that this bad custom would necessitate all the towns  separating, as they could not allow their dead relations to be dug up  and eaten by these greedy people, and he could see no other way to  prevent it. Agbor then gave one of the men to each of the seven towns,  and told some of them to go on the far side of the big river and make  their towns there. The others were to go farther down the river on the  same side as Insofan Mountain, and when they found suitable places,  they were each to kill their man as a sacrifice and then build their  town.
                  All the towns then departed, and when they had found good sites, they  built their towns there.
                  When they had all gone, after a time Agbor began to feel very lonely,  so he left the site of his old town and also went to the Cross River  to live, so that he could see his friends.
                  After that the New Yam feast was held in each town, and the people  still continued to kill and eat a few slaves at the feast, but the  bodies of their relations and friends were kept for a long time above  ground until they had become rotten, so that the greedy people should  not dig them up and eat them.
                  This is why, even at the present time, the people do not like to bury  their dead relations until they have become putrid.
