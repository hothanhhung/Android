                  The thunder was an old mother sheep, and the lightning was her son, a  ram. Whenever the ram got angry he used to go about and burn houses  and knock down trees; he even did damage on the farms, and sometimes  killed people. Whenever the lightning did these things, his mother  used to call out to him in a very loud voice to stop and not to do any  more damage; but the lightning did not care in the least for what his  mother said, and when he was in a bad temper used to do a very large  amount of damage. At last the people could not stand it any longer,  and complained to the king.
                  So the king made a special order that the sheep (Thunder) and her son,  the ram (Lightning), should leave the town and live in the far bush.  This did not do much good, as when the ram got angry he still burnt  the forest, and the flames sometimes spread to the farms and consumed  them.
                  So the people complained again, and the king banished both the  lightning and the thunder from the earth and made them live in the  sky, where they could not cause so much destruction. Ever since, when  the lightning is angry, he commits damage as before, but you can hear  his mother, the thunder, rebuking him and telling him to stop.  Sometimes, however, when the mother has gone away some distance from  her naughty son, you can still see that he is angry and is doing  damage, but his mother's voice cannot be heard.
