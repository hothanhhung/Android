                  In the olden days the moon used often to come down to the earth,  although she lived most of the time in the sky. The moon was a fat  woman with a skin of hide, and she was full of fat meat. She was quite  round, and in the night used to give plenty of light. The moon was  sorry for the poor starving old woman, so she came to her and said,  &quot;You may cut some of my meat away for your food.&quot; This the old woman  did every evening, and the moon got smaller and smaller until you  could scarcely see her at all. Of course this made her give very  little light, and all the people began to grumble in consequence, and  to ask why it was that the moon was getting so thin.
                  At last the people went to the old woman's house where there happened  to be a little girl sleeping. She had been there for some little time,  and had seen the moon come down every evening, and the old woman go  out with her knife and carve her daily supply of meat out of the  moon. As she was very frightened, she told the people all about it, so  they determined to set a watch on the movements of the old woman.
                  That very night the moon came down as usual, and the old woman went  out with her knife and basket to get her food; but before she could  carve any meat all the people rushed out shouting, and the moon was so  frightened that she went back again into the sky, and never came down  again to the earth. The old woman was left to starve in the bush.
                  Ever since that time the moon has hidden herself most of the day, as  she was so frightened, and she still gets very thin once a month, but  later on she gets fat again, and when she is quite fat she gives  plenty of light all the night; but this does not last very long, and  she begins to get thinner and thinner, in the same way as she did when  the old woman was carving her meat from her.
