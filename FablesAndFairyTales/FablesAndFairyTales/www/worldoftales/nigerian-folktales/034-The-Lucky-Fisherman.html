                  One man named Akon Obo, who was very poor, began to make baskets and  traps out of bamboo palm, and then when the river went down he used to  take his traps to a pool and set them baited with palm-nuts. In the  night the big fish used to smell the palm-nuts and go into the trap,  when at once the door would fall down, and in the morning Akon Obo  would go and take the fish out. He was very successful in his fishing,  and used to sell the fish in the market for plenty of money. When he  could afford to pay the dowry he married a woman named Eyong, a native  of Okuni, and had three children by her, but he still continued his  fishing. The eldest son was called Odey, the second Yambi, and the  third Atuk. These three boys, when they grew up, helped their father  with his fishing, and he gradually became wealthy and bought plenty of  slaves. At last he joined the Egbo society, and became one of the  chiefs of the town. Even after he became a chief, he and his sons  still continued to fish.
                  One day, when he was crossing the river in a small dug-out canoe, a  tornado came on very suddenly, and the canoe capsized, drowning the  chief. When his sons heard of the death of their father, they wanted  to go and drown themselves also, but they were persuaded not to by the  people. After searching for two days, they found the dead body some  distance down the river, and brought it back to the town. They then  called their company together to play, dance, and sing for twelve  days, in accordance with their native custom, and much palm wine was  drunk.
                  When the play was finished, they took their father's body to a  hollowed-out cavern, and placed two live slaves with it, one holding a  native lamp of palm-oil, and the other holding a matchet. They were  both tied up, so that they could not escape, and were left there to  keep watch over the dead chief, until they died of starvation.
                  When the cave was covered in, the sons called the chiefs together, and  they played Egbo for seven days, which used up a lot of their late  father's money. When the play was over, the chiefs were surprised at  the amount of money which the sons had been able to spend on the  funeral of their father, as they knew how poor he had been as a young  man. They therefore called him the lucky fisherman.
