In those  days men and animals were friends, and all mixed together quite  freely. At regular intervals King Ambo used to give a feast, and the  elephant used to eat more than any one, although the hippopotamus used  to do his best; however, not being as big as the elephant, although he  was very fat, he was left a long way behind.
                  As the elephant ate so much at these feasts, the tortoise, who was  small but very cunning, made up his mind to put a stop to the elephant  eating more than a fair share of the food provided. He therefore  placed some dry kernels and shrimps, of which the elephant was very  fond, in his bag, and went to the elephant's house to make an  afternoon call.
                  When the tortoise arrived the elephant told him to sit down, so he  made himself comfortable, and, having shut one eye, took one palm  kernel and a shrimp out of his bag, and commenced to eat them with  much relish.
                  When the elephant saw the tortoise eating, he said, as he was always  hungry himself, &quot;You seem to have some good food there; what are you  eating?&quot;
                  The tortoise replied that the food was &quot;sweet too much,&quot; but was  rather painful to him, as he was eating one of his own eyeballs; and  he lifted up his head, showing one eye closed.
                  The elephant then said, &quot;If the food is so good, take out one of my  eyes and give me the same food.&quot;
                  The tortoise, who was waiting for this, knowing how greedy the  elephant was, had brought a sharp knife with him for that very  purpose, and said to the elephant, &quot;I cannot reach your eye, as you  are so big.&quot;
                  The elephant then took the tortoise up in his trunk and lifted him up.  As soon as he came near the elephant's eye, with one quick scoop of  the sharp knife he had the elephant's right eye out. The elephant  trumpeted with pain; but the tortoise gave him some of the dried  kernels and shrimps, and they so pleased the elephant's palate that he  soon forgot the pain.
                  Very soon the elephant said, &quot;That food is so sweet, I must have some  more&quot;; but the tortoise told him that before he could have any the  other eye must come out. To this the elephant agreed; so the tortoise  quickly got his knife to work, and very soon the elephant's left eye  was on the ground, thus leaving the elephant quite blind. The tortoise  then slid down the elephant's trunk on to the ground and hid himself.  The elephant then began to make a great noise, and started pulling  trees down and doing much damage, calling out for the tortoise; but  of course he never answered, and the elephant could not find him.
                  The next morning, when the elephant heard the people passing, he asked  them what the time was, and the bush buck, who was nearest, shouted  out, &quot;The sun is now up, and I am going to market to get some yams and  fresh leaves for my food.&quot;
                  Then the elephant perceived that the tortoise had deceived him, and  began to ask all the passers-by to lend him a pair of eyes, as he  could not see, but every one refused, as they wanted their eyes  themselves. At last the worm grovelled past, and seeing the big  elephant, greeted him in his humble way. He was much surprised when  the king of the forest returned his salutation, and very much  flattered also.
                  The elephant said, &quot;Look here, worm, I have mislaid my eyes. Will you  lend me yours for a few days? I will return them next market-day.&quot;
                  The worm was so flattered at being noticed by the elephant that he  gladly consented, and took his eyes out&mdash;which, as every one knows,  were very small&mdash;and gave them to the elephant. When the elephant had  put the worm's eyes into his own large eye-sockets, the flesh  immediately closed round them so tightly that when the market-day  arrived it was impossible for the elephant to get them out again to  return to the worm; and although the worm repeatedly made applications  to the elephant to return his eyes, the elephant always pretended not  to hear, and sometimes used to say in a very loud voice, &quot;If there are  any worms about, they had better get out of my way, as they are so  small I cannot see them, and if I tread on them they will be squashed  into a nasty mess.&quot;
                  Ever since then the worms have been blind, and for the same reason  elephants have such small eyes, quite out of proportion to the size of  their huge bodies
