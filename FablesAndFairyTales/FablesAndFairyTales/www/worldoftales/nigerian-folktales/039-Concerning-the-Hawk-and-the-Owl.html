All the  people, birds, animals, and fish, were under the king, and had to obey  him. His favourite messenger was the hawk, as he could travel so  quickly.
                  The hawk served the king faithfully for several years, and when he  wanted to retire, he asked what the king proposed to do for him, as  very soon he would be too old to work any more. So the king told the  hawk to bring any living creature, bird or animal, to him, and he  would allow the hawk for the future to live on that particular species  without any trouble. The hawk then flew over a lot of country, and  went from forest to forest, until at last he found a young owl which  had tumbled out of its nest. This the hawk brought to the king, who  told him that for the future he might eat owls. The hawk then carried  the owlet away, and told his friends what the king had said.
                  One of the wisest of them said, &quot;Tell me when you seized the young  owlet, what did the parents say?&quot; And the hawk replied that the father  and mother owls kept quite quiet, and never said anything. The hawk's  friend then advised him to return the owlet to his parents, as he  could never tell what the owls would do to him in the night-time, and  as they had made no noise, they were no doubt plotting in their minds  some deep and cruel revenge.
                  The next day the hawk carried the owlet back to his parents and left  him near the nest. He then flew about, trying to find some other bird  which would do as his food; but as all the birds had heard that the  hawk had seized the owlet, they hid themselves, and would not come out  when the hawk was near. He therefore could not catch any birds.
                  As he was flying home he saw a lot of fowls near a house, basking in  the sun and scratching in the dust. There were also several small  chickens running about and chasing insects, or picking up anything  they could find to eat, with the old hen following them and clucking  and calling to them from time to time. When the hawk saw the chickens,  he made up his mind that he would take one, so he swooped down and  caught the smallest in his strong claws. Immediately he had seized the  chicken the cocks began to make a great noise, and the hen ran after  him and tried to make him drop her child, calling loudly, with her  feathers fluffed out and making dashes at him. But he carried it off,  and all the fowls and chickens at once ran screaming into the houses,  some taking shelter under bushes and others trying to hide themselves in the long grass. He then carried the chicken to the king, telling  him that he had returned the owlet to his parents, as he did not want  him for food; so the king told the hawk that for the future he could  always feed on chickens.
                  The hawk then took the chicken home, and his friend who dropped in to  see him, asked him what the parents of the chicken had done when they  saw their child taken away; so the hawk said&mdash;
                  &quot;They all made a lot of noise, and the old hen chased me, but although  there was a great disturbance amongst the fowls, nothing happened.&quot;
                  His friend then said as the fowls had made much palaver, he was quite  safe to kill and eat the chickens, as the people who made plenty of  noise in the daytime would go to sleep at night and not disturb him,  or do him any injury; the only people to be afraid of were those who  when they were injured, kept quite silent; you might be certain then  that they were plotting mischief, and would do harm in the  night-time.
