Their mother first of all had married a  chief of Duke Town, when Ekpo was born; but after a time she got tired  of him and went to Old Town, where she married Ejuqua and gave birth  to Etim.
                  Both of the boys grew up and became very rich. Ekpo had a cock, of  which he was very fond, and every day when Ekpo sat down to meals the  cock used to fly on to the table and feed also. Ama Ukwa, a native of  Old Town, who was rather poor, was jealous of the two brothers, and  made up his mind if possible to bring about a quarrel between them,  although he pretended to be friends with both.
                  One day Ekpo, the elder brother, gave a big dinner, to which Etim and  many other people were invited. Ama Ukwa was also present. A very good  dinner was laid for the guests, and plenty of palm wine was provided.  When they had commenced to feed, the pet cock flew on to the table and  began to feed off Etim's plate. Etim then told one of his servants to  seize the cock and tie him up in the house until after the feast. So  the servant carried the cock to Etim's house and tied him up for  safety.
                  After much eating and drinking, Etim returned home late at night with  his friend Ama Ukwa, and just before they went to bed, Ama Ukwa saw  Ekpo's cock tied up. So early in the morning he went to Ekpo's house,  who received him gladly.
                  About eight o'clock, when it was time for Ekpo to have his early  morning meal, he noticed that his pet cock was missing. When he  remarked upon its absence, Ama Ukwa told him that his brother had  seized the cock the previous evening during the dinner, and was going  to kill it, just to see what Ekpo would do. When Ekpo heard this, he  was very vexed, and sent Ama Ukwa back to his brother to ask him to  return the cock immediately. Instead of delivering the message as he  had been instructed, Ama Ukwa told Etim that his elder brother was so  angry with him for taking away his friend, the cock, that he would  fight him, and had sent Ama Ukwa on purpose to declare war between the  two towns.
                  Etim then told Ama Ukwa to return to Ekpo, and say he would be  prepared for anything his brother could do. Ama Ukwa then advised Ekpo  to call all his people in from their farms, as Etim would attack him,  and on his return he advised Etim to do the same. He then arranged a  day for the fight to take place between the two brothers and their  people. Etim then marched his men to the other side of the creek, and  waited for his brother; so Ama Ukwa went to Ekpo and told him that  Etim had got all his people together and was waiting to fight. Ekpo  then led his men against his brother, and there was a big battle,  many men being killed on both sides. The fighting went on all day,  until at last, towards evening, the other chiefs of Calabar met and  determined to stop it; so they called the Egbo men together and sent  them out with their drums, and eventually the fight stopped.
                  Three days later a big palaver was held, when each of the brothers was  told to state his case. When they had done so, it was found that Ama  Ukwa had caused the quarrel, and the chiefs ordered that he should be  killed. His father, who was a rich man, offered to give the Egbos five  thousand rods, five cows, and seven slaves to redeem his son, but they  decided to refuse his offer.
                  The next day, after being severely flogged, he was left for  twenty-four hours tied up to a tree, and the following day his head  was cut off.
                  Ekpo was then ordered to kill his pet cock, so that it should not  cause any further trouble between himself and his brother, and a law  was passed that for the future no one should keep a pet cock or any  other tame animal.
