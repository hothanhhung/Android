The sun very often used to visit the water, but  the water never returned his visits. At last the sun asked the water  why it was that he never came to see him in his house, the water  replied that the sun's house was not big enough, and that if he came  with his people he would drive the sun out.
                  He then said, &quot;If you wish me to visit you, you must build a very  large compound; but I warn you that it will have to be a tremendous  place, as my people are very numerous, and take up a lot of room.&quot;
                  The sun promised to build a very big compound, and soon afterwards he  returned home to his wife, the moon, who greeted him with a broad  smile when he opened the door. The sun told the moon what he had  promised the water, and the next day commenced building a huge  compound in which to entertain his friend.
                  When it was completed, he asked the water to come and visit him the  next day.
                  When the water arrived, he called out to the sun, and asked him  whether it would be safe for him to enter, and the sun answered,  &quot;Yes, come in, my friend.&quot;
                  The water then began to flow in, accompanied by the fish and all the  water animals.
                  Very soon the water was knee-deep, so he asked the sun if it was still  safe, and the sun again said, &quot;Yes,&quot; so more water came in.
                  When the water was level with the top of a man's head, the water said  to the sun, &quot;Do you want more of my people to come?&quot; and the sun and  moon both answered, &quot;Yes,&quot; not knowing any better, so the water flowed  on, until the sun and moon had to perch themselves on the top of the  roof.
                  Again the water addressed the sun, but receiving the same answer, and  more of his people rushing in, the water very soon overflowed the top  of the roof, and the sun and moon were forced to go up into the sky,  where they have remained ever since.
