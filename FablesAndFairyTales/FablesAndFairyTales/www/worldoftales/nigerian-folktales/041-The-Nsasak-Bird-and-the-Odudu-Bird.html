                  The 'Nsasak bird is very small, having a shining breast of green and  red; he also has blue and yellow feathers and red round the neck, and  his chief food consists of ripe palm nuts. The Odudu bird, on the  other hand, is much larger, about the size of a magpie, with plenty of  feathers, but a very thin body; he has a long tail, and his colouring  is black and brown with a cream-coloured breast. He lives chiefly on  grasshoppers, and is also very fond of crickets, which make a noise at  night.
                  Both the 'Nsasak bird and the Odudu were great friends, and used to  live together. They both made up their minds that they would go before  the king and try to be made chiefs, but the Odudu bird was quite  confident that he would win, as he was so much bigger than the 'Nsasak  bird. He therefore offered to starve for seven days.
                  The king then told them both to build houses which he would inspect,  and then he would have them fastened up, and the one who could remain  the longest without eating would be made the chief.
                  They both then built their houses, but the 'Nsasak bird, who was very  cunning, thought that he could not possibly live for seven days  without eating anything. He therefore made a tiny hole in the wall  (being very small himself), which he covered up so that the king would  not notice it on his inspection. The king then came and looked  carefully over both houses, but failed to detect the little hole in  the 'Nsasak bird's house, as it had been hidden so carefully. He  therefore declared that both houses were safe, and then ordered the  two birds to go inside their respective houses, and the doors were  carefully fastened on the outside.
                  Every morning at dawn the 'Nsasak bird used to escape through the  small opening he had left high up in the wall, and fly away a long  distance and enjoy himself all day, taking care, however, that none of  the people on the farms should see him. Then when the sun went down he  would fly back to his little house and creep through the hole in the  wall, closing it carefully after him. When he was safely inside he  would call out to his friend the Odudu and ask him if he felt hungry,  and told him that he must bear it well if he wanted to win, as he, the  'Nsasak bird, was very fit, and could go on for a long time.
                  For several days this went on, the voice of the Odudu bird growing  weaker and weaker every night, until at last he could no longer reply.  Then the little bird knew that his friend must be dead. He was very  sorry, but could not report the matter, as he was supposed to be  confined inside his house.
                  When the seven days had expired the king came and had both the doors  of the houses opened. The 'Nsasak bird at once flew out, and, perching  on a branch of a tree which grew near, sang most merrily; but the  Odudu bird was found to be quite dead, and there was very little left  of him, as the ants had eaten most of his body, leaving only the  feathers and bones on the floor.
                  The king therefore at once appointed the 'Nsasak bird to be the head  chief of all the small birds, and in the Ibibio country even to the  present time the small boys who have bows and arrows are presented  with a prize, which sometimes takes the shape of a female goat, if  they manage to shoot a 'Nsasak bird, as the 'Nsasak bird is the king  of the small birds, and most difficult to shoot on account of his  wiliness and his small size.
