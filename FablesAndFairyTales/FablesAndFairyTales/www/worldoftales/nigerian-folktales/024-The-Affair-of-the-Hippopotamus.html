The  hippo had seven large fat wives, of whom he was very fond. Now and  then he used to give a big feast to the people, but a curious thing  was that, although every one knew the hippo, no one, except his seven  wives, knew his name.
                  At one of the feasts, just as the people were about to sit down, the  hippo said, &quot;You have come to feed at my table, but none of you know  my name. If you cannot tell my name, you shall all of you go away  without your dinner.&quot;
                  As they could not guess his name, they had to go away and leave all  the good food and tombo behind them. But before they left, the  tortoise stood up and asked the hippopotamus what he would do if he  told him his name at the next feast? So the hippo replied that he  would be so ashamed of himself, that he and his whole family would  leave the land, and for the future would dwell in the water.
                  Now it was the custom for the hippo and his seven wives to go down  every morning and evening to the river to wash and have a drink. Of  this custom the tortoise was aware. The hippo used to walk first, and  the seven wives followed. One day when they had gone down to the river  to bathe, the tortoise made a small hole in the middle of the path,  and then waited. When the hippo and his wives returned, two of the  wives were some distance behind, so the tortoise came out from where  he had been hiding, and half buried himself in the hole he had dug,  leaving the greater part of his shell exposed. When the two hippo  wives came along, the first one knocked her foot against the  tortoise's shell, and immediately called out to her husband, &quot;Oh!  Isantim, my husband, I have hurt my foot.&quot; At this the tortoise was  very glad, and went joyfully home, as he had found out the hippo's  name.
                  When the next feast was given by the hippo, he made the same condition  about his name; so the tortoise got up and said, &quot;You promise you will  not kill me if I tell you your name?&quot; and the hippo promised. The  tortoise then shouted as loud as he was able, &quot;Your name is Isantim,&quot;  at which a cheer went up from all the people, and then they sat down  to their dinner.
                  When the feast was over, the hippo, with his seven wives, in  accordance with his promise, went down to the river, and they have  always lived in the water from that day till now; and although they  come on shore to feed at night, you never find a hippo on the land in  the daytime.
