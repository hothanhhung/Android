Even the leopard was very thin, in spite of the  arrangement he had made with the animals to bring him their old  grandmothers and mothers for food.
                  In the early days of the famine (as you will remember) the leopard had  killed the mother of the tortoise, in consequence of which the  tortoise was very angry with the leopard, and determined if possible  to be revenged upon him. The tortoise, who was very clever, had  discovered a shallow lake full of fish in the middle of the forest,  and every morning he used to go to the lake and, without much trouble,  bring back enough food for himself and his family. One day the leopard  met the tortoise and noticed how fat he was. As he was very thin  himself he decided to watch the tortoise, so the next morning he hid  himself in the long grass near the tortoise's house and waited very  patiently, until at last the tortoise came along quite slowly,  carrying a basket which appeared to be very heavy. Then the leopard  sprang out, and said to the tortoise:
                  &quot;What have you got in that basket?&quot;
                  The tortoise, as he did not want to lose his breakfast, replied that  he was carrying firewood back to his home. Unfortunately for the  tortoise the leopard had a very acute sense of smell, and knew at once  that there was fish in the basket, so he said:
                  &quot;I know there is fish in there, and I am going to eat it.&quot;
                  The tortoise, not being in a position to refuse, as he was such a poor  creature, said:
                  &quot;Very well. Let us sit down under this shady tree, and if you will  make a fire I will go to my house and get pepper, oil, and salt, and  then we will feed together.&quot;
                  To this the leopard agreed, and began to search about for dry wood,  and started the fire. In the meantime the tortoise waddled off to his  house, and very soon returned with the pepper, salt, and oil; he also  brought a long piece of cane tie-tie, which is very strong. This he  put on the ground, and began boiling the fish. Then he said to the  leopard:
                  &quot;While we are waiting for the fish to cook, let us play at tying one  another up to a tree. You may tie me up first, and when I say  'Tighten,' you must loose the rope, and when I say 'Loosen,' you must  tighten the rope.&quot;
                  The leopard, who was very hungry, thought that this game would make  the time pass more quickly until the fish was cooked, so he said he  would play. The tortoise then stood with his back to the tree and  said, &quot;Loosen the rope,&quot; and the leopard, in accordance with the rules  of the game, began to tie up the tortoise. Very soon the tortoise  shouted out, &quot;Tighten!&quot; and the leopard at once unfastened the  tie-tie, and the tortoise was free. The tortoise then said, &quot;Now,  leopard, it is your turn;&quot; so the leopard stood up against the tree  and called out to the tortoise to loosen the rope, and the tortoise at  once very quickly passed the rope several times round the leopard and  got him fast to the tree. Then the leopard said, &quot;Tighten the rope;&quot;  but instead of playing the game in accordance with the rules he had  laid down, the tortoise ran faster and faster with the rope round the  leopard, taking great care, however, to keep out of reach of the  leopard's claws, and very soon had the leopard so securely fastened  that it was quite impossible for him to free himself.
                  All this time the leopard was calling out to the tortoise to let him  go, as he was tired of the game; but the tortoise only laughed, and  sat down at the fireside and commenced his meal. When he had finished  he packed up the remainder of the fish for his family, and prepared to  go, but before he started he said to the leopard:
                  &quot;You killed my mother and now you want to take my fish. It is not  likely that I am going to the lake to get fish for you, so I shall  leave you here to starve.&quot;
                  He then threw the remains of the pepper and salt into the leopard's  eyes and quietly went on his way, leaving the leopard roaring with  pain.
                  All that day and throughout the night the leopard was calling out for  some one to release him, and vowing all sorts of vengeance on the  tortoise; but no one came, as the people and animals of the forest do  not like to hear the leopard's voice.
                  In the morning, when the animals began to go about to get their food,  the leopard called out to every one he saw to come and untie him, but  they all refused, as they knew that if they did so the leopard would  most likely kill them at once and eat them. At last a bush rat came  near and saw the leopard tied up to the tree and asked him what was  the matter, so the leopard told him that he had been playing a game of  &quot;tight&quot; and &quot;loose&quot; with the tortoise, and that he had tied him up and  left him there to starve. The leopard then implored the bush rat to  cut the ropes with his sharp teeth. The bush rat was very sorry for  the leopard; but at the same time he knew that, if he let the leopard  go, he would most likely be killed and eaten, so he hesitated, and  said that he did not quite see his way to cutting the ropes. But this  bush rat, being rather kind-hearted, and having had some experience of  traps himself, could sympathise with the leopard in his uncomfortable  position. He therefore thought for a time, and then hit upon a plan.  He first started to dig a hole under the tree, quite regardless of the  leopard's cries. When he had finished the hole he came out and cut one  of the ropes, and immediately ran into his hole, and waited there to  see what would happen; but although the leopard struggled frantically,  he could not get loose, as the tortoise had tied him up so fast. After  a time, when he saw that there was no danger, the bush rat crept out  again and very carefully bit through another rope, and then retired to  his hole as before. Again nothing happened, and he began to feel more  confidence, so he bit several strands through one after the other  until at last the leopard was free. The leopard, who was ravenous with  hunger, instead of being grateful to the bush rat, directly he was  free, made a dash at the bush rat with his big paw, but just missed  him, as the bush rat had dived for his hole; but he was not quite  quick enough to escape altogether, and the leopard's sharp claws  scored his back and left marks which he carried to his grave.
                  Ever since then the bush rats have had white spots on their skins,  which represent the marks of the leopard's claws.
