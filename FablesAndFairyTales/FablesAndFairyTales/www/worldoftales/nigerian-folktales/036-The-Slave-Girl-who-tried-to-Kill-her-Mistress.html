                
                  A man called Akpan, who was a native of Oku, a town in the Ibibio  country, admired a girl called Emme very much, who lived at Ibibio,  and wished to marry her, as she was the finest girl in her company. It  was the custom in those days for the parents to demand such a large  amount for their daughters as dowry, that if after they were married  they failed to get on with their husbands, as they could not redeem  themselves, they were sold as slaves. Akpan paid a very large sum as  dowry for Emme, and she was put in the fatting-house until the proper  time arrived for her to marry.
                  Akpan told the parents that when their daughter was ready they must  send her over to him. This they promised to do. Emme's father was a  rich man, and after seven years had elapsed, and it became time for  her to go to her husband, he saw a very fine girl, who had also just  come out of the fatting-house, and whom the parents wished to sell as  a slave. Emme's father therefore bought her, and gave her to his  daughter as her handmaiden.
                  The next day Emme's little sister, being very anxious to go with her,  obtained the consent of her mother, and they started off together, the  slave girl carrying a large bundle containing clothes and presents  from Emme's father. Akpan's house was a long day's march from where  they lived. When they arrived just outside the town they came to a  spring, where the people used to get their drinking water from, but no  one was allowed to bathe there. Emme, however, knew nothing about  this. They took off their clothes to wash close to the spring, and  where there was a deep hole which led to the Water Ju Ju's house. The  slave girl knew of this Ju Ju, and thought if she could get her  mistress to bathe, she would be taken by the Ju Ju, and she would then  be able to take her place and marry Akpan. So they went down to bathe,  and when they were close to the water the slave girl pushed her  mistress in, and she at once disappeared. The little girl then began  to cry, but the slave girl said, &quot;If you cry any more I will kill you  at once, and throw your body into the hole after your sister.&quot; And she  told the child that she must never mention what had happened to any  one, and particularly not to Akpan, as she was going to represent her  sister and marry him, and that if she ever told any one what she had  seen, she would be killed at once. She then made the little girl carry  her load to Akpan's house.
                  When they arrived, Akpan was very much disappointed at the slave  girl's appearance, as she was not nearly as pretty and fine as he had  expected her to be; but as he had not seen Emme for seven years, he  had no suspicion that the girl was not really Emme, for whom he had  paid such a large dowry. He then called all his company together to  play and feast, and when they arrived they were much astonished, and  said, &quot;Is this the fine woman for whom you paid so much dowry, and  whom you told us so much about?&quot; And Akpan could not answer them.
                  The slave girl was then for some time very cruel to Emme's little  sister, and wanted her to die, so that her position would be more  secure with her husband. She beat the little girl every day, and  always made her carry the largest water-pot to the spring; she also  made the child place her finger in the fire to use as firewood. When  the time came for food, the slave girl went to the fire and got a  burning piece of wood and burned the child all over the body with it.  When Akpan asked her why she treated the child so badly, she replied  that she was a slave that her father had bought for her. When the  little girl took the heavy water-pot to the river to fill it there was  no one to lift it up for her, so that she could not get it on to her  head; she therefore had to remain a long time at the spring, and at  last began calling for her sister Emme to come and help her.
                  When Emme heard her little sister crying for her, she begged the Water  Ju Ju to allow her to go and help her, so he told her she might go,  but that she must return to him again immediately. When the little  girl saw her sister she did not want to leave her, and asked to be  allowed to go into the hole with her. She then told Emme how very  badly she had been treated by the slave girl, and her elder sister  told her to have patience and wait, that a day of vengeance would  arrive sooner or later. The little girl went back to Akpan's house  with a glad heart as she had seen her sister, but when she got to the house, the slave girl said, &quot;Why have you been so long getting the  water?&quot; and then took another stick from the fire and burnt the little  girl again very badly, and starved her for the rest of the day.
                  This went on for some time, until, one day, when the child went to the  river for water, after all the people had gone, she cried out for her  sister as usual, but she did not come for a long time, as there was a  hunter from Akpan's town hidden near watching the hole, and the Water  Ju Ju told Emme that she must not go; but, as the little girl went on  crying bitterly, Emme at last persuaded the Ju Ju to let her go,  promising to return quickly. When she emerged from the water, she  looked very beautiful with the rays of the setting sun shining on her  glistening body. She helped her little sister with her water-pot, and  then disappeared into the hole again.
                  The hunter was amazed at what he had seen, and when he returned, he  told Akpan what a beautiful woman had come out of the water and had  helped the little girl with her water-pot. He also told Akpan that he  was convinced that the girl he had seen at the spring was his proper  wife, Emme, and that the Water Ju Ju must have taken her.
                  Akpan then made up his mind to go out and watch and see what happened,  so, in the early morning the hunter came for him, and they both went  down to the river, and hid in the forest near the water-hole.
                  When Akpan saw Emme come out of the water, he recognised her at once,  and went home and considered how he should get her out of the power of the Water Ju Ju. He was advised by some of his friends to go to an  old woman, who frequently made sacrifices to the Water Ju Ju, and  consult her as to what was the best thing to do.
                  When he went to her, she told him to bring her one white slave, one  white goat, one piece of white cloth, one white chicken, and a basket  of eggs. Then, when the great Ju Ju day arrived, she would take them  to the Water Ju Ju, and make a sacrifice of them on his behalf. The  day after the sacrifice was made, the Water Ju Ju would return the  girl to her, and she would bring her to Akpan.
                  Akpan then bought the slave, and took all the other things to the old  woman, and, when the day of the sacrifice arrived, he went with his  friend the hunter and witnessed the old woman make the sacrifice. The  slave was bound up and led to the hole, then the old woman called to  the Water Ju Ju and cut the slave's throat with a sharp knife and  pushed him into the hole. She then did the same to the goat and  chicken, and also threw the eggs and cloth in on top of them.
                  After this had been done, they all returned to their homes. The next  morning at dawn the old woman went to the hole, and found Emme  standing at the side of the spring, so she told her that she was her  friend, and was going to take her to her husband. She then took Emme  back to her own home, and hid her in her room, and sent word to Akpan  to come to her house, and to take great care that the slave woman knew  nothing about the matter.
                  So Akpan left the house secretly by the back door, and arrived at the  old woman's house without meeting anybody.
                  When Emme saw Akpan, she asked for her little sister, so he sent his  friend, the hunter, for her to the spring, and he met her carrying her  water-pot to get the morning supply of water for the house, and  brought her to the old woman's house with him.
                  When Emme had embraced her sister, she told her to return to the house  and do something to annoy the slave woman, and then she was to run as  fast as she could back to the old woman's house, where, no doubt, the  slave girl would follow her, and would meet them all inside the house,  and see Emme, who she believed she had killed.
                  The little girl did as she was told, and, directly she got into the  house, she called out to the slave woman: &quot;Do you know that you are a  wicked woman, and have treated me very badly? I know you are only my  sister's slave, and you will be properly punished.&quot; She then ran as  hard as she could to the old woman's house. Directly the slave woman  heard what the little girl said, she was quite mad with rage, and  seized a burning stick from the fire, and ran after the child; but the  little one got to the house first, and ran inside, the slave woman  following close upon her heels with the burning stick in her hand.
                  Then Emme came out and confronted the slave woman, and she at once  recognised her mistress, whom she thought she had killed, so she stood  quite still.
                  Then they all went back to Akpan's house, and when they arrived  there, Akpan asked the slave woman what she meant by pretending that  she was Emme, and why she had tried to kill her. But, seeing she was  found out, the slave woman had nothing to say.
                  Many people were then called to a play to celebrate the recovery of  Akpan's wife, and when they had all come, he told them what the slave  woman had done.
                  After this, Emme treated the slave girl in the same way as she had  treated her little sister. She made her put her fingers in the fire,  and burnt her with sticks. She also made her beat foo-foo with her  head in a hollowed-out tree, and after a time she was tied up to a  tree and starved to death.
                  Ever since that time, when a man marries a girl, he is always present  when she comes out of the fatting-house and takes her home himself, so  that such evil things as happened to Emme and her sister may not occur  again.
