                  The rat, who was very poor, fell in love with one of the king's  servant girls, but was unable to give her any presents, as he had no  money.
                  At last he thought of the king's store, so in the night-time, being  quite small, he had little difficulty, having made a hole in the roof,  in getting into the store. He then stole corn and native pears, and  presented them to his sweetheart.
                  At the end of the month, when the cat had to render her account of the  things in the store to the king, it was found that a lot of corn and  native pears were missing. The king was very angry at this, and asked  the cat for an explanation. But the cat could not account for the  loss, until one of her friends told her that the rat had been stealing  the corn and giving it to the girl.
                  When the cat told the king, he called the girl before him and had her  flogged. The rat he handed over to the cat to deal with, and  dismissed them both from his service. The cat was so angry at this  that she killed and ate the rat, and ever since that time whenever a  cat sees a rat she kills and eats it.
