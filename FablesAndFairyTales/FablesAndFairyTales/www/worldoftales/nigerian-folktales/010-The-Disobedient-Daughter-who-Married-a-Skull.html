All the young men in the country wanted to  marry her on account of her beauty; but she refused all offers of  marriage in spite of repeated entreaties from her parents, as she was  very vain, and said she would only marry the best-looking man in the  country, who would have to be young and strong, and capable of loving  her properly. Most of the men her parents wanted her to marry,  although they were rich, were old men and ugly, so the girl continued  to disobey her parents, at which they were very much grieved. The  skull who lived in the spirit land heard of the beauty of this Calabar  virgin, and thought he would like to possess her; so he went about  amongst his friends and borrowed different parts of the body from  them, all of the best. From one he got a good head, another lent him a  body, a third gave him strong arms, and a fourth lent him a fine pair  of legs. At last he was complete, and was a very perfect specimen of  manhood.
                  He then left the spirit land and went to Cobham market, where he saw  Afiong, and admired her very much.
                  About this time Afiong heard that a very fine man had been seen in the  market, who was better-looking than any of the natives. She therefore  went to the market at once, and directly she saw the Skull in his  borrowed beauty, she fell in love with him, and invited him to her  house. The Skull was delighted, and went home with her, and on his  arrival was introduced by the girl to her parents, and immediately  asked their consent to marry their daughter. At first they refused, as  they did not wish her to marry a stranger, but at last they agreed.
                  He lived with Afiong for two days in her parents' house, and then said  he wished to take his wife back to his country, which was far off. To  this the girl readily agreed, as he was such a fine man, but her  parents tried to persuade her not to go. However, being very  headstrong, she made up her mind to go, and they started off together.  After they had been gone a few days the father consulted his Ju Ju  man, who by casting lots very soon discovered that his daughter's  husband belonged to the spirit land, and that she would surely be  killed. They therefore all mourned her as dead.
                  After walking for several days, Afiong and the Skull crossed the  border between the spirit land and the human country. Directly they  set foot in the spirit land, first of all one man came to the Skull  and demanded his legs, then another his head, and the next his body,  and so on, until in a few minutes the skull was left by itself in all  its natural ugliness. At this the girl was very frightened, and wanted  to return home, but the skull would not allow this, and ordered her to  go with him. When they arrived at the skull's house they found his  mother, who was a very old woman quite incapable of doing any work,  who could only creep about. Afiong tried her best to help her, and  cooked her food, and brought water and firewood for the old woman. The  old creature was very grateful for these attentions, and soon became  quite fond of Afiong.
                  One day the old woman told Afiong that she was very sorry for her, but  all the people in the spirit land were cannibals, and when they heard  there was a human being in their country, they would come down and  kill her and eat her. The skull's mother then hid Afiong, and as she  had looked after her so well, she promised she would send her back to  her country as soon as possible, providing that she promised for the  future to obey her parents. This Afiong readily consented to do. Then  the old woman sent for the spider, who was a very clever hairdresser,  and made him dress Afiong's hair in the latest fashion. She also  presented her with anklets and other things on account of her  kindness. She then made a Ju Ju and called the winds to come and  convey Afiong to her home. At first a violent tornado came, with  thunder, lightning and rain, but the skull's mother sent him away as  unsuitable. The next wind to come was a gentle breeze, so she told the  breeze to carry Afiong to her mother's house, and said good-bye to  her. Very soon afterwards the breeze deposited Afiong outside her  home, and left her there.
                  When the parents saw their daughter they were very glad, as they had  for some months given her up as lost. The father spread soft animals'  skins on the ground from where his daughter was standing all the way  to the house, so that her feet should not be soiled. Afiong then  walked to the house, and her father called all the young girls who  belonged to Afiong's company to come and dance, and the feasting and  dancing was kept up for eight days and nights. When the rejoicing was  over, the father reported what had happened to the head chief of the  town. The chief then passed a law that parents should never allow  their daughters to marry strangers who came from a far country. Then  the father told his daughter to marry a friend of his, and she  willingly consented, and lived with him for many years, and had many  children.
