                
                  Ituen was a young man of Calabar. He was the only child of his  parents, and they were extremely fond of him, as he was of fine  proportions and very good to look upon. They were poor people, and  when Ituen grew up and became a man, he had very little money indeed,  in fact he had so little food, that every day it was his custom to go  to the market carrying an empty bag, into which he used to put  anything eatable he could find after the market was over.
                  At this time Offiong was king. He was an old man, but he had plenty of  wives. One of these women, named Attem, was quite young and very  good-looking. She did not like her old husband, but wished for a young  and handsome husband. She therefore told her servant to go round the  town and the market to try and find such a man and to bring him at  night by the side door to her house, and she herself would let him in,  and would take care that her husband did not discover him.
                  That day the servant went all round the town, but failed to find any  young man good-looking enough. She was just returning to report her  ill-success when, on passing through the market-place, she saw Ituen picking up the remains of corn and other things which had been left on  the ground. She was immediately struck with his fine appearance and  strength, and saw that he was just the man to make a proper lover for  her mistress, so she went up to him, and said that the queen had sent  for him, as she was so taken with his good looks. At first Ituen was  frightened and refused to go, as he knew that if the King discovered  him he would be killed. However, after much persuasion he consented,  and agreed to go to the queen's side door when it was dark.
                  When night came he went with great fear and trembling, and knocked  very softly at the queen's door. The door was opened at once by the  queen herself, who was dressed in all her best clothes, and had many  necklaces, beads, and anklets on. Directly she saw Ituen she fell in  love with him at once, and praised his good looks and his shapely  limbs. She then told her servant to bring water and clothes, and after  he had had a good wash and put on a clean cloth, he rejoined the  queen. She hid him in her house all the night.
                  In the morning when he wished to go she would not let him, but,  although it was very dangerous, she hid him in the house, and secretly  conveyed food and clothes to him. Ituen stayed there for two weeks,  and then he said that it was time for him to go and see his mother,  but the queen persuaded him to stay another week, much against his  will.
                  When the time came for him to depart, the queen got together fifty  carriers with presents for Ituen's mother who, she knew, was a poor  woman. Ten slaves carried three hundred rods; the other forty carried  yams, pepper, salt, tobacco, and cloth. When all the presents arrived  Ituen's mother was very pleased and embraced her son, and noticed with  pleasure that he was looking well, and was dressed in much finer  clothes than usual; but when she heard that he had attracted the  queen's attention she was frightened, as she knew the penalty imposed  on any one who attracted the attention of one of the king's wives.
                  Ituen stayed for a month in his parents' house and worked on the farm;  but the queen could not be without her lover any longer, so she sent  for him to go to her at once. Ituen went again, and, as before,  arrived at night, when the queen was delighted to see him again.
                  In the middle of the night some of the king's servants, who had been  told the story by the slaves who had carried the presents to Ituen's  mother, came into the queen's room and surprised her there with Ituen.  They hastened to the king, and told him what they had seen. Ituen was  then made a prisoner, and the king sent out to all his people to  attend at the palaver house to hear the case tried. He also ordered  eight Egbos to attend armed with machetes. When the case was tried  Ituen was found guilty, and the king told the eight Egbo men to take  him into the bush and deal with him according to native custom. The  Egbos then took Ituen into the bush and tied him up to a tree; then  with a sharp knife they cut off his lower jaw, and carried it to the  king.
                  When the queen heard the fate of her lover she was very sad, and cried  for three days. This made the king angry, so he told the Egbos to  deal with his wife and her servant according to their law. They took  the queen and the servant into the bush, where Ituen was still tied up  to the tree dying and in great pain. Then, as the queen had nothing to  say in her defence, they tied her and the girl up to different trees,  and cut the queen's lower jaw off in the same way as they had her  lover's. The Egbos then put out both the eyes of the servant, and left  all three to die of starvation. The king then made an Egbo law that  for the future no one belonging to Ituen's family was to go into the  market on market day, and that no one was to pick up the rubbish in  the market. The king made an exception to the law in favour of the  vulture and the dog, who were not considered very fine people, and  would not be likely to run off with one of the king's wives, and that  is why you still find vultures and dogs doing scavenger in the  market-places even at the present time.
