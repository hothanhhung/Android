                  The cause of their unfriendliness was that the elephant was always  boasting about his strength to all his friends, which made the bush  cow ashamed of himself, as he was always a good fighter and feared no  man or animal. When the matter was referred to the head chief, he  decided that the best way to settle the dispute was for the elephant  and bush cow to meet and fight one another in a large open space. He  decided that the fight should take place in the market-place on the  next market-day, when all the country people could witness the battle.
                  When the market-day arrived, the bush cow went out in the early  morning and took up his position some distance from the town on the  main road to the market, and started bellowing and tearing up the  ground. As the people passed he asked them whether they had seen  anything of the &quot;Big, Big one,&quot; which was the name of the elephant.
                  A bush buck, who happened to be passing, replied, &quot;I am only a small  antelope, and am on my way to the market. How should I know anything  of the movements of the 'Big, Big one?'&quot; The bush cow then allowed him  to pass.
                  After a little time the bush cow heard the elephant trumpeting, and  could hear him as he came nearer breaking down trees and trampling  down the small bush.
                  When the elephant came near the bush cow, they both charged one  another, and a tremendous fight commenced, in which a lot of damage  was done to the surrounding farms, and many of the people were  frightened to go to the market, and returned to their houses.
                  At last the monkey, who had been watching the fight from a distance  whilst he was jumping from branch to branch high up in the trees,  thought he would report what he had seen to the head chief. Although  he forgot several times what it was he wanted to do, which is a little  way monkeys have, he eventually reached the chief's house, and jumped  upon the roof, where he caught and ate a spider. He then climbed to  the ground again, and commenced playing with a small stick. But he  very soon got tired of this, and then, picking up a stone, he rubbed  it backwards and forwards on the ground in an aimless sort of way,  whilst looking in the opposite direction. This did not last long, and  very soon he was busily engaged in a minute personal inspection.
                  His attention was then attracted by a large praying mantis, which had  fluttered into the house, making much clatter with its wings. When it  settled, it immediately assumed its usual prayerful attitude.
                  The monkey, after a careful stalk, seized the mantis, and having  deliberately pulled the legs off one after the other, he ate the body,  and sat down with his head on one side, looking very wise, but in  reality thinking of nothing.
                  Just then the chief caught sight of him while he was scratching  himself, and shouted out in a loud voice, &quot;Ha, monkey, is that you?  What do you want here?&quot;
                  At the chief's voice the monkey gave a jump, and started chattering  like anything. After a time he replied very nervously: &quot;Oh yes, of  course! Yes, I came to see you.&quot; Then he said to himself, &quot;I wonder  what on earth it was I came to tell the chief?&quot; but it was no use,  everything had gone out of his head.
                  Then the chief told the monkey he might take one of the ripe plantains  hanging up in the verandah. The monkey did not want telling twice, as  he was very fond of plantains. He soon tore off the skin, and holding  the plantain in both hands, took bite after bite from the end of it,  looking at it carefully after each bite.
                  Then the chief remarked that the elephant and the bush cow ought to  have arrived by that time, as they were going to have a great fight.  Directly the monkey heard this he remembered what it was he wanted to  tell the chief; so, having swallowed the piece of plantain he had  placed in the side of his cheek, he said: &quot;Ah! that reminds me,&quot; and  then, after much chattering and making all sorts of funny grimaces, finally made the chief understand that the elephant and bush cow,  instead of fighting where they had been told, were having it out in  the bush on the main road leading to the market, and had thus stopped  most of the people coming in.
                  When the chief heard this he was much incensed, and called for his bow  and poisoned arrows, and went to the scene of the combat. He then shot  both the elephant and the bush cow, and throwing his bow and arrows  away, ran and hid himself in the bush. About six hours afterwards both  the elephant and bush cow died in great pain.
                  Ever since, when wild animals want to fight between themselves, they  always fight in the big bush and not on the public roads; but as the  fight was never definitely decided between the elephant and the bush  cow, whenever they meet one another in the forest, even to the present  time, they always fight.
