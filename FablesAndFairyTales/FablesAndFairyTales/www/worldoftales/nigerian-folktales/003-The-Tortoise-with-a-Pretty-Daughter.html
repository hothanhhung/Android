Now the tortoise was looked upon as  the wisest of all beasts and men. This king had a son named Ekpenyon,  to whom he gave fifty young girls as wives, but the prince did not  like any of them. The king was very angry at this, and made a law that  if any man had a daughter who was finer than the prince's wives, and  who found favour in his son's eyes, the girl herself and her father  and mother should be killed.
                  Now about this time the tortoise and his wife had a daughter who was  very beautiful. The mother thought it was not safe to keep such a fine  child, as the prince might fall in love with her, so she told her  husband that her daughter ought to be killed and thrown away into the  bush. The tortoise, however, was unwilling, and hid her until she was  three years old. One day, when both the tortoise and his wife were  away on their farm, the king's son happened to be hunting near their  house, and saw a bird perched on the top of the fence round the house.  The bird was watching the little girl, and was so entranced with her  beauty that he did not notice the prince coming. The prince shot the  bird with his bow and arrow, and it dropped inside the fence, so the  prince sent his servant to gather it. While the servant was looking  for the bird he came across the little girl, and was so struck with  her form, that he immediately returned to his master and told him what  he had seen. The prince then broke down the fence and found the child,  and fell in love with her at once. He stayed and talked with her for a  long time, until at last she agreed to become his wife. He then went  home, but concealed from his father the fact that he had fallen in  love with the beautiful daughter of the tortoise.
                  But the next morning he sent for the treasurer, and got sixty pieces  of cloth and three hundred rods, and sent them to the tortoise.  Then in the early afternoon he went down to the tortoise's house, and  told him that he wished to marry his daughter. The tortoise saw at  once that what he had dreaded had come to pass, and that his life was  in danger, so he told the prince that if the king knew, he would kill  not only himself (the tortoise), but also his wife and daughter. The  prince replied that he would be killed himself before he allowed the  tortoise and his wife and daughter to be killed. Eventually, after  much argument, the tortoise consented, and agreed to hand his daughter  to the prince as his wife when she arrived at the proper age. Then the  prince went home and told his mother what he had done. She was in  great distress at the thought that she would lose her son, of whom she  was very proud, as she knew that when the king heard of his son's  disobedience he would kill him. However, the queen, although she knew  how angry her husband would be, wanted her son to marry the girl he  had fallen in love with, so she went to the tortoise and gave him some  money, clothes, yams, and palm-oil as further dowry on her son's  behalf in order that the tortoise should not give his daughter to  another man. For the next five years the prince was constantly with  the tortoise's daughter, whose name was Adet, and when she was about  to be put in the fatting house, the prince told his father that he  was going to take Adet as his wife. On hearing this the king was very  angry, and sent word all round his kingdom that all people should come  on a certain day to the market-place to hear the palaver. When the  appointed day arrived the market-place was quite full of people, and  the stones belonging to the king and queen were placed in the middle  of the market-place.
                  When the king and queen arrived all the people stood up and greeted  them, and they then sat down on their stones. The king then told his  attendants to bring the girl Adet before him. When she arrived the  king was quite astonished at her beauty. He then told the people that  he had sent for them to tell them that he was angry with his son for  disobeying him and taking Adet as his wife without his knowledge, but  that now he had seen her himself he had to acknowledge that she was  very beautiful, and that his son had made a good choice. He would  therefore forgive his son.
                  When the people saw the girl they agreed that she was very fine and  quite worthy of being the prince's wife, and begged the king to cancel  the law he had made altogether, and the king agreed; and as the law  had been made under the &quot;Egbo&quot; law, he sent for eight Egbos, and  told them that the order was cancelled throughout his kingdom, and  that for the future no one would be killed who had a daughter more  beautiful than the prince's wives, and gave the Egbos palm wine and  money to remove the law, and sent them away. Then he declared that  the tortoise's daughter, Adet, should marry his son, and he made them  marry the same day. A great feast was then given which lasted for  fifty days, and the king killed five cows and gave all the people  plenty of foo-foo and palm-oil chop, and placed a large number of  pots of palm wine in the streets for the people to drink as they  liked. The women brought a big play to the king's compound, and there  was singing and dancing kept up day and night during the whole time.  The prince and his companions also played in the market square. When  the feast was over the king gave half of his kingdom to the tortoise  to rule over, and three hundred slaves to work on his farm. The prince  also gave his father-in-law two hundred women and one hundred girls to  work for him, so the tortoise became one of the richest men in the  kingdom. The prince and his wife lived together for a good many years  until the king died, when the prince ruled in his place. And all this  shows that the tortoise is the wisest of all men and animals.
                  Moral.&mdash;Always have pretty daughters, as no matter how poor they may  be, there is always the chance that the king's son may fall in love  with them, and they may thus become members of the royal house and  obtain much wealth.
