At first the  mother sheep refused, but as the young lamb was anxious to travel and  see something of the world, and begged to be allowed to go, at last  she reluctantly consented. So in the morning at daylight the bat and  the lamb set off together, the lamb carrying the bat's drinking-horn.  When they reached half-way, the bat told the lamb to leave the horn  underneath a bamboo tree. Directly he arrived at the house, he sent  the lamb back to get the horn. When the lamb had gone the bat's  father-in-law brought him food, and the bat ate it all, leaving  nothing for the lamb. When the lamb returned, the bat said to him,  &quot;Hullo! you have arrived at last I see, but you are too late for food;  it is all finished.&quot; He then sent the lamb back to the tree with the  horn, and when the lamb returned again it was late, and he went  supperless to bed. The next day, just before it was time for food,  the bat sent the lamb off again for the drinking-horn, and when the  food arrived the bat, who was very greedy, ate it all up a second  time. This mean behaviour on the part of the bat went on for four  days, until at last the lamb became quite thin and weak. The bat  decided to return home the next day, and it was all the lamb could do  to carry his load. When he got home to his mother the lamb complained  bitterly of the treatment he had received from the bat, and was  baa-ing all night, complaining of pains in his inside. The old mother  sheep, who was very fond of her children, determined to be revenged on  the bat for the cruel way he had starved her lamb; she therefore  decided to consult the tortoise, who, although very poor, was  considered by all people to be the wisest of all animals. When the old  sheep had told the whole story to the tortoise, he considered for some  time, and then told the sheep that she might leave the matter entirely  to him, and he would take ample revenge on the bat for his cruel  treatment of her son.
                  Very soon after this the bat thought he would again go and see his  father-in-law, so he went to the mother sheep again and asked her for  one of her sons to carry his load as before. The tortoise, who  happened to be present, told the bat that he was going in that  direction, and would cheerfully carry his load for him. They set out  on their journey the following day, and when they arrived at the  half-way halting-place the bat pursued the same tactics that he had on  the previous occasion. He told the tortoise to hide his drinking-horn  under the same tree as the lamb had hidden it before; this the  tortoise did, but when the bat was not looking he picked up the  drinking-horn again and hid it in his bag. When they arrived at the  house the tortoise hung the horn up out of sight in the back yard, and  then sat down in the house. Just before it was time for food the bat  sent the tortoise to get the drinking-horn, and the tortoise went  outside into the yard, and waited until he heard that the beating of  the boiled yams into foo-foo had finished; he then went into the house  and gave the drinking-horn to the bat, who was so surprised and angry,  that when the food was passed he refused to eat any of it, so the  tortoise ate it all; this went on for four days, until at last the bat  became as thin as the poor little lamb had been on the previous  occasion. At last the bat could stand the pains of his inside no  longer, and secretly told his mother-in-law to bring him food when the  tortoise was not looking. He said, &quot;I am now going to sleep for a  little, but you can wake me up when the food is ready.&quot; The tortoise,  who had been listening all the time, being hidden in a corner out of  sight, waited until the bat was fast asleep, and then carried him very  gently into the next room and placed him on his own bed; he then very  softly and quietly took off the bat's cloth and covered himself in it,  and lay down where the bat had been; very soon the bat's mother-in-law  brought the food and placed it next to where the bat was supposed to  be sleeping, and having pulled his cloth to wake him, went away. The  tortoise then got up and ate all the food; when he had finished he  carried the bat back again, and took some of the palm-oil and foo-foo  and placed it inside the bat's lips while he was asleep; then the  tortoise went to sleep himself. In the morning when he woke up the bat  was more hungry than ever, and in a very bad temper, so he sought out  his mother-in-law and started scolding her, and asked her why she had  not brought his food as he had told her to do. She replied she had  brought his food, and that he had eaten it; but this the bat denied,  and accused the tortoise of having eaten the food. The woman then said  she would call the people in and they should decide the matter; but  the tortoise slipped out first and told the people that the best way  to find out who had eaten the food was to make both the bat and  himself rinse their mouths out with clean water into a basin. This  they decided to do, so the tortoise got his tooth-stick which he  always used, and having cleaned his teeth properly, washed his mouth  out, and returned to the house.
                  When all the people had arrived the woman told them how the bat had  abused her, and as he still maintained stoutly that he had had no food  for five days, the people said that both he and the tortoise should  wash their mouths out with clean water into two clean calabashes; this  was done, and at once it could clearly be seen that the bat had been  eating, as there were distinct traces of the palm-oil and foo-foo  which the tortoise had put inside his lips floating on the water. When  the people saw this they decided against the bat, and he was so  ashamed that he ran away then and there, and has ever since always  hidden himself in the bush during the daytime, so that no one could  see him, and only comes out at night to get his food.
                  The next day the tortoise returned to the mother sheep and told her  what he had done, and that the bat was for ever disgraced. The old  sheep praised him very much, and told all her friends, in consequence  of which the reputation of the tortoise for wisdom was greatly  increased throughout the whole country.
