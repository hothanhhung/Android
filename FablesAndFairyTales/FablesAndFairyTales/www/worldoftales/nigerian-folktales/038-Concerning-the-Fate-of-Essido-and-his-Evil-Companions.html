He had many large canoes, and plenty of slaves to paddle  them. These canoes he used to fill up with new yams&mdash;each canoe being  under one head slave and containing eight paddles; the canoes were  capable of holding three puncheons of palm-oil, and cost eight hundred  rods each. When they were full, about ten of them used to start off  together and paddle to Rio del Rey. They went through creeks all the  way, which run through mangrove swamps, with palm-oil trees here and  there. Sometimes in the tornado season it was very dangerous crossing  the creeks, as the canoes were so heavily laden, having only a few  inches above the water, that quite a small wave would fill the canoe  and cause it to sink to the bottom. Although most of the boys could  swim, it often happened that some of them were lost, as there are many  large alligators in these waters. After four days' hard paddling they  would arrive at Rio del Rey, where they had very little difficulty in  exchanging their new yams for bags of dried shrimps and sticks with  smoked fish on them.
                  Chief Oborri had two sons, named Eyo I. and Essido. Their mother  having died when they were babies, the children were brought up by  their father. As they grew up, they developed entirely different  characters. The eldest was very hard-working and led a solitary life;  but the younger son was fond of gaiety and was very lazy, in fact, he  spent most of his time in the neighbouring towns playing and dancing.  When the two boys arrived at the respective ages of eighteen and  twenty their father died, and they were left to look after themselves.  According to native custom, the elder son, Eyo I., was entitled to the  whole of his father's estate; but being very fond of his younger  brother, he gave him a large number of rods and some land with a  house. Immediately Essido became possessed of the money he became  wilder than ever, gave big feasts to his companions, and always had  his house full of women, upon whom he spent large sums. Although the  amount his brother had given him on his father's death was very large,  in the course of a few years Essido had spent it all. He then sold  his house and effects, and spent the proceeds on feasting.
                  While he had been living this gay and unprofitable life, Eyo I. had  been working harder than ever at his father's old trade, and had made  many trips to Rio del Rey himself. Almost every week he had canoes  laden with yams going down river and returning after about twelve days  with shrimps and fish, which Eyo I. himself disposed of in the  neighbouring markets, and he very rapidly became a rich man. At  intervals he remonstrated with Essido on his extravagance, but his  warnings had no effect; if anything, his brother became worse. At last  the time arrived when all his money was spent, so Essido went to his  brother and asked him to lend him two thousand rods, but Eyo refused,  and told Essido that he would not help him in any way to continue his  present life of debauchery, but that if he liked to work on the farm  and trade, he would give him a fair share of the profits. This Essido  indignantly refused, and went back to the town and consulted some of  the very few friends he had left as to what was the best thing to do.
                  The men he spoke to were thoroughly bad men, and had been living upon  Essido for a long time. They suggested to him that he should go round  the town and borrow money from the people he had entertained, and then  they would run away to Akpabryos town, which was about four days'  march from Calabar. This Essido did, and managed to borrow a lot of  money, although many people refused to lend him anything. Then at  night he set off with his evil companions, who carried his money, as  they had not been able to borrow any themselves, being so well known.  When they arrived at Akpabryos town they found many beautiful women  and graceful dancers. They then started the same life again, until  after a few weeks most of the money had gone. They then met and  consulted together how to get more money, and advised Essido to return  to his rich brother, pretending that he was going to work and give up  his old life; he should then get poison from a man they knew of, and  place it in his brother's food, so that he would die, and then Essido  would become possessed of all his brother's wealth, and they would be  able to live in the same way as they had formerly. Essido, who had  sunk very low, agreed to this plan, and they left Akpabryos town the  next morning. After marching for two days, they arrived at a small hut  in the bush where a man who was an expert poisoner lived, called  Okponesip. He was the head Ju Ju man of the country, and when they had  bribed him with eight hundred rods he swore them to secrecy, and gave  Essido a small parcel containing a deadly poison which he said would  kill his brother in three months. All he had to do was to place the  poison in his brother's food.
                  When Essido returned to his brother's house he pretended to be very  sorry for his former mode of living, and said that for the future he  was going to work. Eyo I. was very glad when he heard this, and at  once asked his brother in, and gave him new clothes and plenty to eat.
                  In the evening, when supper was being prepared, Essido went into the  kitchen, pretending he wanted to get a light from the fire for his  pipe. The cook being absent and no one about, he put the poison in  the soup, and then returned to the living-room. He then asked for some  tombo, which was brought, and when he had finished it, he said he did  not want any supper, and went to sleep. His brother, Eyo I., had  supper by himself and consumed all the soup. In a week's time he began  to feel very ill, and as the days passed he became worse, so he sent  for his Ju Ju man.
                  When Essido saw him coming, he quietly left the house; but the Ju Ju  man, by casting lots, very soon discovered that it was Essido who had  given poison to his brother. When he told Eyo I. this, he would not  believe it, and sent him away. However, when Essido returned, his  elder brother told him what the Ju Ju man had said, but that he did  not believe him for one moment, and had sent him away. Essido was much  relieved when he heard this, but as he was anxious that no suspicion  of the crime should be attached to him, he went to the Household Ju  Ju,and having first sworn that he had never administered poison  to his brother, he drank out of the pot.
                  Three months after he had taken the poison Eyo I. died, much to the  grief of every one who knew him, as he was much respected, not only on  account of his great wealth, but because he was also an upright and  honest man, who never did harm to any one.
                  Essido kept his brother's funeral according to the usual custom, and  there was much playing and dancing, which was kept up for a long time.  Then Essido paid off his old creditors in order to make himself  popular, and kept open house, entertaining most lavishly, and spending  his money in many foolish ways. All the bad women about collected at  his house, and his old evil companions went on as they had done  before.
                  Things got so bad that none of the respectable people would have  anything to do with him, and at last the chiefs of the country, seeing  the way Essido was squandering his late brother's estate, assembled  together, and eventually came to the conclusion that he was a witch  man, and had poisoned his brother in order to acquire his position.  The chiefs, who were all friends of the late Eyo, and who were very  sorry at the death, as they knew that if he had lived he would have  become a great and powerful chief, made up their minds to give Essido  the Ekpawor Ju Ju, which is a very strong medicine, and gets into  men's heads, so that when they have drunk it they are compelled to  speak the truth, and if they have done wrong they die very shortly.  Essido was then told to dress himself and attend the meeting at the  palaver house, and when he arrived the chiefs charged him with having  killed his brother by witchcraft. Essido denied having done so, but  the chiefs told him that if he were innocent he must prove it by  drinking the bowl of Ekpawor medicine which was placed before him. As  he could not refuse to drink, he drank the bowl off in great fear and  trembling, and very soon the Ju Ju having got hold of him, he  confessed that he had poisoned his brother, but that his friends had  advised him to do so. About two hours after drinking the Ekpawor,  Essido died in great pain.
                  The friends were then brought to the meeting and tied up to posts, and  questioned as to the part they had taken in the death of Eyo. As they  were too frightened to answer, the chiefs told them that they knew  from Essido that they had induced him to poison his brother. They were  then taken to the place where Eyo was buried, the grave having been  dug open, and their heads were cut off and fell into the grave, and  their bodies were thrown in after them as a sacrifice for the wrong  they had done. The grave was then filled up again.
                  Ever since that time, whenever any one is suspected of being a witch,  he is tried by the Ekpawor Ju Ju.
