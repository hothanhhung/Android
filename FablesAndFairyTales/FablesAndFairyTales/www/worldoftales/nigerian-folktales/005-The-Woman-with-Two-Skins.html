                
                  Eyamba I. of Calabar was a very powerful king. He fought and conquered  all the surrounding countries, killing all the old men and women, but  the able-bodied men and girls he caught and brought back as slaves,  and they worked on the farms until they died.
                  This king had two hundred wives, but none of them had borne a son to  him. His subjects, seeing that he was becoming an old man, begged him  to marry one of the spider's daughters, as they always had plenty of  children. But when the king saw the spider's daughter he did not like  her, as she was ugly, and the people said it was because her mother  had had so many children at the same time. However, in order to please  his people he married the ugly girl, and placed her among his other  wives, but they all complained because she was so ugly, and said she  could not live with them. The king, therefore, built her a separate  house for herself, where she was given food and drink the same as the  other wives. Every one jeered at her on account of her ugliness; but  she was not really ugly, but beautiful, as she was born with two  skins, and at her birth her mother was made to promise that she should  never remove the ugly skin until a certain time arrived save only  during the night, and that she must put it on again before dawn. Now  the king's head wife knew this, and was very fearful lest the king  should find it out and fall in love with the spider's daughter; so she  went to a Ju Ju man and offered him two hundred rods to make a potion  that would make the king forget altogether that the spider's daughter  was his wife. This the Ju Ju man finally consented to do, after much  haggling over the price, for three hundred and fifty rods; and he made  up some &quot;medicine,&quot; which the head wife mixed with the king's food.  For some months this had the effect of making the king forget the  spider's daughter, and he used to pass quite close to her without  recognising her in any way. When four months had elapsed and the king  had not once sent for Adiaha (for that was the name of the spider's  daughter), she began to get tired, and went back to her parents. Her  father, the spider, then took her to another Ju Ju man, who, by making  spells and casting lots, very soon discovered that it was the king's  head wife who had made the Ju Ju and had enchanted the king so that he  would not look at Adiaha. He therefore told the spider that Adiaha  should give the king some medicine which he would prepare, which would  make the king remember her. He prepared the medicine, for which the  spider had to pay a large sum of money; and that very day Adiaha made  a small dish of food, into which she had placed the medicine, and  presented it to the king. Directly he had eaten the dish his eyes were  opened and he recognised his wife, and told her to come to him that  very evening. So in the afternoon, being very joyful, she went down to  the river and washed, and when she returned she put on her best cloth  and went to the king's palace.
                  Directly it was dark and all the lights were out she pulled off her  ugly skin, and the king saw how beautiful she was, and was very  pleased with her; but when the cock crowed Adiaha pulled on her ugly  skin again, and went back to her own house.
                  This she did for four nights running, always taking the ugly skin off  in the dark, and leaving before daylight in the morning. In course of  time, to the great surprise of all the people, and particularly of the  king's two hundred wives, she gave birth to a son; but what surprised  them most of all was that only one son was born, whereas her mother  had always had a great many children at a time, generally about fifty.
                  The king's head wife became more jealous than ever when Adiaha had a  son; so she went again to the Ju Ju man, and by giving him a large  present induced him to give her some medicine which would make the  king sick and forget his son. And the medicine would then make the  king go to the Ju Ju man, who would tell him that it was his son who  had made him sick, as he wanted to reign instead of his father. The Ju  Ju man would also tell the king that if he wanted to recover he must  throw his son away into the water.
                  And the king, when he had taken the medicine, went to the Ju Ju man,  who told him everything as had been arranged with the head wife. But  at first the king did not want to destroy his son. Then his chief  subjects begged him to throw his son away, and said that perhaps in a  year's time he might get another son. So the king at last agreed, and  threw his son into the river, at which the mother grieved and cried  bitterly.
                  Then the head wife went again to the Ju Ju man and got more medicine,  which made the king forget Adiaha for three years, during which time  she was in mourning for her son. She then returned to her father, and  he got some more medicine from his Ju Ju man, which Adiaha gave to the  king. And the king knew her and called her to him again, and she lived  with him as before. Now the Ju Ju who had helped Adiaha's father, the  spider, was a Water Ju Ju, and he was ready when the king threw his  son into the water, and saved his life and took him home and kept him  alive. And the boy grew up very strong.
                  After a time Adiaha gave birth to a daughter, and her the jealous wife  also persuaded the king to throw away. It took a longer time to  persuade him, but at last he agreed, and threw his daughter into the  water too, and forgot Adiaha again. But the Water Ju Ju was ready  again, and when he had saved the little girl, he thought the time had  arrived to punish the action of the jealous wife; so he went about  amongst the head young men and persuaded them to hold a wrestling  match in the market-place every week. This was done, and the Water Ju  Ju told the king's son, who had become very strong, and was very like  to his father in appearance, that he should go and wrestle, and that  no one would be able to stand up before him. It was then arranged  that there should be a grand wrestling match, to which all the  strongest men in the country were invited, and the king promised to  attend with his head wife.
                  On the day of the match the Water Ju Ju told the king's son that he  need not be in the least afraid, and that his Ju Ju was so powerful,  that even the strongest and best wrestlers in the country would not be  able to stand up against him for even a few minutes. All the people of  the country came to see the great contest, to the winner of which the  king had promised to present prizes of cloth and money, and all the  strongest men came. When they saw the king's son, whom nobody knew,  they laughed and said, &quot;Who is this small boy? He can have no chance  against us.&quot; But when they came to wrestle, they very soon found that  they were no match for him. The boy was very strong indeed,  beautifully made and good to look upon, and all the people were  surprised to see how like he was to the king.
                  After wrestling for the greater part of the day the king's son was  declared the winner, having thrown every one who had stood up against  him; in fact, some of his opponents had been badly hurt, and had their  arms or ribs broken owing to the tremendous strength of the boy. After  the match was over the king presented him with cloth and money, and  invited him to dine with him in the evening. The boy gladly accepted  his father's invitation; and after he had had a good wash in the  river, put on his cloth and went up to the palace, where he found the  head chiefs of the country and some of the king's most favoured wives.  They then sat down to their meal, and the king had his own son, whom  he did not know, sitting next to him. On the other side of the boy sat  the jealous wife, who had been the cause of all the trouble. All  through the dinner this woman did her best to make friends with the  boy, with whom she had fallen violently in love on account of his  beautiful appearance, his strength, and his being the best wrestler in  the country. The woman thought to herself, &quot;I will have this boy as my  husband, as my husband is now an old man and will surely soon die.&quot;  The boy, however, who was as wise as he was strong, was quite aware of  everything the jealous woman had done, and although he pretended to be  very flattered at the advances of the king's head wife, he did not  respond very readily, and went home as soon as he could.
                  When he returned to the Water Ju Ju's house he told him everything  that had happened, and the Water Ju Ju said&mdash;
                  &quot;As you are now in high favour with the king, you must go to him  to-morrow and beg a favour from him. The favour you will ask is that  all the country shall be called together, and that a certain case  shall be tried, and that when the case is finished, the man or woman  who is found to be in the wrong shall be killed by the Egbos before  all the people.&quot;
                  So the following morning the boy went to the king, who readily granted  his request, and at once sent all round the country appointing a day  for all the people to come in and hear the case tried. Then the boy  went back to the Water Ju Ju, who told him to go to his mother and  tell her who he was, and that when the day of the trial arrived, she  was to take off her ugly skin and appear in all her beauty, for the  time had come when she need no longer wear it. This the son did.
                  When the day of trial arrived, Adiaha sat in a corner of the square,  and nobody recognised the beautiful stranger as the spider's daughter.  Her son then sat down next to her, and brought his sister with him.  Immediately his mother saw her she said&mdash;
                  &quot;This must be my daughter, whom I have long mourned as dead,&quot; and  embraced her most affectionately.
                  The king and his head wife then arrived and sat on their stones in the  middle of the square, all the people saluting them with the usual  greetings. The king then addressed the people, and said that he had  called them together to hear a strong palaver at the request of the  young man who had been the victor of the wrestling, and who had  promised that if the case went against him he would offer up his life  to the Egbo. The king also said that if, on the other hand, the case  was decided in the boy's favour, then the other party would be killed,  even though it were himself or one of his wives; whoever it was would  have to take his or her place on the killing-stone and have their  heads cut off by the Egbos. To this all the people agreed, and said  they would like to hear what the young man had to say. The young man  then walked round the square, and bowed to the king and the people,  and asked the question, &quot;Am I not worthy to be the son of any chief in  the country?&quot; And all the people answered &quot;Yes!&quot;
                  The boy then brought his sister out into the middle, leading her by  the hand. She was a beautiful girl and well made. When every one had  looked at her he said, &quot;Is not my sister worthy to be any chief's  daughter?&quot; And the people replied that she was worthy of being any  one's daughter, even the king's. Then he called his mother Adiaha, and  she came out, looking very beautiful with her best cloth and beads on,  and all the people cheered, as they had never seen a finer woman. The  boy then asked them, &quot;Is this woman worthy of being the king's wife?&quot;  And a shout went up from every one present that she would be a proper  wife for the king, and looked as if she would be the mother of plenty  of fine healthy sons.
                  Then the boy pointed out the jealous woman who was sitting next to the  king, and told the people his story, how that his mother, who had two  skins, was the spider's daughter; how she had married the king, and  how the head wife was jealous and had made a bad Ju Ju for the king,  which made him forget his wife; how she had persuaded the king to  throw himself and his sister into the river, which, as they all knew,  had been done, but the Water Ju Ju had saved both of them, and had  brought them up.
                  Then the boy said: &quot;I leave the king and all of you people to judge my  case. If I have done wrong, let me be killed on the stone by the  Egbos; if, on the other hand, the woman has done evil, then let the  Egbos deal with her as you may decide.&quot;
                  When the king knew that the wrestler was his son he was very glad, and  told the Egbos to take the jealous woman away, and punish her in  accordance with their laws. The Egbos decided that the woman was a  witch; so they took her into the forest and tied her up to a stake,  and gave her two hundred lashes with a whip made from hippopotamus  hide, and then burnt her alive, so that she should not make any more  trouble, and her ashes were thrown into the river. The king then  embraced his wife and daughter, and told all the people that she,  Adiaha, was his proper wife, and would be the queen for the future.
                  When the palaver was over, Adiaha was dressed in fine clothes and  beads, and carried back in state to the palace by the king's servants.
                  That night the king gave a big feast to all his subjects, and told  them how glad he was to get back his beautiful wife whom he had never  known properly before, also his son who was stronger than all men, and  his fine daughter. The feast continued for a hundred and sixty-six  days; and the king made a law that if any woman was found out getting  medicine against her husband, she should be killed at once. Then the  king built three new compounds, and placed many slaves in them, both  men and women. One compound he gave to his wife, another to his son,  and the third he gave to his daughter. They all lived together quite  happily for some years until the king died, when his son came to the  throne and ruled in his stead.
