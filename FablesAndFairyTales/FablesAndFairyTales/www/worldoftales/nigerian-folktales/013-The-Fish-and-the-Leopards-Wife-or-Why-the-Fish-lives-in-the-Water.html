Now the leopard had a very fine wife, with whom the fish fell in  love. And after a time, whenever the leopard was absent in the bush,  the fish used to go to his house and make love to the leopard's wife,  until at last an old woman who lived near informed the leopard what  happened whenever he went away. At first the leopard would not believe  that the fish, who had been his friend for so long, would play such a  low trick, but one night he came back unexpectedly, and found the fish  and his wife together; at this the leopard was very angry, and was  going to kill the fish, but he thought as the fish had been his friend  for so long, he would not deal with him himself, but would report his  behaviour to King Eyo. This he did, and the king held a big palaver,  at which the leopard stated his case quite shortly, but when the fish  was put upon his defence he had nothing to say, so the king addressing  his subjects said, &quot;This is a very bad case, as the fish has been the  leopard's friend, and has been trusted by him, but the fish has taken  advantage of his friend's absence, and has betrayed him.&quot; The king,  therefore, made an order that for the future the fish should live in  the water, and that if he ever came on the land he should die; he also  said that all men and animals should kill and eat the fish whenever  they could catch him, as a punishment for his behaviour with his  friend's wife.
