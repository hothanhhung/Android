                
                  Efriam Duke was an ancient king of Calabar. He was a peaceful man, and  did not like war. He had a wonderful drum, the property of which, when  it was beaten, was always to provide plenty of good food and drink. So  whenever any country declared war against him, he used to call all his  enemies together and beat his drum; then to the surprise of every one,  instead of fighting the people found tables spread with all sorts of  dishes, fish, foo-foo, palm-oil chop, soup, cooked yams and ocros, and  plenty of palm wine for everybody. In this way he kept all the country  quiet, and sent his enemies away with full stomachs, and in a happy  and contented frame of mind. There was only one drawback to possessing  the drum, and that was, if the owner of the drum walked over any stick  on the road or stept over a fallen tree, all the food would  immediately go bad, and three hundred Egbo men would appear with  sticks and whips and beat the owner of the drum and all the invited  guests very severely.
                  Efriam Duke was a rich man. He had many farms and hundreds of slaves,  a large store of kernels on the beach, and many puncheons of palm-oil.  He also had fifty wives and many children. The wives were all fine  women and healthy; they were also good mothers, and all of them had  plenty of children, which was good for the king's house.
                  Every few months the king used to issue invitations to all his  subjects to come to a big feast, even the wild animals were invited;  the elephants, hippopotami, leopards, bush cows, and antelopes used to  come, for in those days there was no trouble, as they were friendly  with man, and when they were at the feast they did not kill one  another. All the people and the animals as well were envious of the  king's drum and wanted to possess it, but the king would not part with  it.
                  One morning Ikwor Edem, one of the king's wives, took her little  daughter down to the spring to wash her, as she was covered with yaws,  which are bad sores all over the body. The tortoise happened to be up  a palm tree, just over the spring, cutting nuts for his midday meal;  and while he was cutting, one of the nuts fell to the ground, just in  front of the child. The little girl, seeing the good food, cried for  it, and the mother, not knowing any better, picked up the palm nut and  gave it to her daughter. Directly the tortoise saw this he climbed  down the tree, and asked the woman where his palm nut was. She replied  that she had given it to her child to eat. Then the tortoise, who very  much wanted the king's drum, thought he would make plenty palaver over  this and force the king to give him the drum, so he said to the mother  of the child&mdash;
                  &quot;I am a poor man, and I climbed the tree to get food for myself and my  family. Then you took my palm nut and gave it to your child. I shall  tell the whole matter to the king, and see what he has to say when he  hears that one of his wives has stolen my food,&quot; for this, as every  one knows, is a very serious crime according to native custom.
                  Ikwor Edem then said to the tortoise&mdash;
                  &quot;I saw your palm nut lying on the ground, and thinking it had fallen  from the tree, I gave it to my little girl to eat, but I did not steal  it. My husband the king is a rich man, and if you have any complaint  to make against me or my child, I will take you before him.&quot;
                  So when she had finished washing her daughter at the spring she took  the tortoise to her husband, and told him what had taken place. The  king then asked the tortoise what he would accept as compensation for  the loss of his palm nut, and offered him money, cloth, kernels or  palm-oil, all of which things the tortoise refused one after the  other.
                  The king then said to the tortoise, &quot;What will you take? You may have  anything you like.&quot;
                  And the tortoise immediately pointed to the king's drum, and said that  it was the only thing he wanted.
                  In order to get rid of the tortoise the king said, &quot;Very well, take  the drum,&quot; but he never told the tortoise about the bad things that  would happen to him if he stept over a fallen tree, or walked over a  stick on the road.
                  The tortoise was very glad at this, and carried the drum home in  triumph to his wife, and said, &quot;I am now a rich man, and shall do no  more work. Whenever I want food, all I have to do is to beat this  drum, and food will immediately be brought to me, and plenty to  drink.&quot;
                  His wife and children were very pleased when they heard this, and  asked the tortoise to get food at once, as they were all hungry. This  the tortoise was only too pleased to do, as he wished to show off his  newly acquired wealth, and was also rather hungry himself, so he beat  the drum in the same way as he had seen the king do when he wanted  something to eat, and immediately plenty of food appeared, so they all  sat down and made a great feast. The tortoise did this for three days,  and everything went well; all his children got fat, and had as much as  they could possibly eat. He was therefore very proud of his drum, and  in order to display his riches he sent invitations to the king and all  the people and animals to come to a feast. When the people received  their invitations they laughed, as they knew the tortoise was very  poor, so very few attended the feast; but the king, knowing about the  drum, came, and when the tortoise beat the drum, the food was brought  as usual in great profusion, and all the people sat down and enjoyed  their meal very much. They were much astonished that the poor tortoise  should be able to entertain so many people, and told all their friends  what fine dishes had been placed before them, and that they had never  had a better dinner. The people who had not gone were very sorry when  they heard this, as a good feast, at somebody else's expense, is not  provided every day. After the feast all the people looked upon the  tortoise as one of the richest men in the kingdom, and he was very  much respected in consequence. No one, except the king, could  understand how the poor tortoise could suddenly entertain so  lavishly, but they all made up their minds that if the tortoise ever  gave another feast, they would not refuse again.
                  When the tortoise had been in possession of the drum for a few weeks  he became lazy and did no work, but went about the country boasting of  his riches, and took to drinking too much. One day after he had been  drinking a lot of palm wine at a distant farm, he started home  carrying his drum; but having had too much to drink, he did not notice  a stick in the path. He walked over the stick, and of course the Ju Ju  was broken at once. But he did not know this, as nothing happened at  the time, and eventually he arrived at his house very tired, and still  not very well from having drunk too much. He threw the drum into a  corner and went to sleep. When he woke up in the morning the tortoise  began to feel hungry, and as his wife and children were calling out  for food, he beat the drum; but instead of food being brought, the  house was filled with Egbo men, who beat the tortoise, his wife and  children, badly. At this the tortoise was very angry, and said to  himself&mdash;
                  &quot;I asked every one to a feast, but only a few came, and they had  plenty to eat and drink. Now, when I want food for myself and my  family, the Egbos come and beat me. Well, I will let the other people  share the same fate, as I do not see why I and my family should be  beaten when I have given a feast to all people.&quot;
                  He therefore at once sent out invitations to all the men and animals  to come to a big dinner the next day at three o'clock in the  afternoon.
                  When the time arrived many people came, as they did not wish to lose  the chance of a free meal a second time. Even the sick men, the lame,  and the blind got their friends to lead them to the feast. When they  had all arrived, with the exception of the king and his wives, who  sent excuses, the tortoise beat his drum as usual, and then quickly  hid himself under a bench, where he could not be seen. His wife and  children he had sent away before the feast, as he knew what would  surely happen. Directly he had beaten the drum three hundred Egbo men  appeared with whips, and started flogging all the guests, who could  not escape, as the doors had been fastened. The beating went on for  two hours, and the people were so badly punished, that many of them  had to be carried home on the backs of their friends. The leopard was  the only one who escaped, as directly he saw the Egbo men arrive he  knew that things were likely to be unpleasant, so he gave a big spring  and jumped right out of the compound.
                  When the tortoise was satisfied with the beating the people had  received he crept to the door and opened it. The people then ran away,  and when the tortoise gave a certain tap on the drum all the Egbo men  vanished. The people who had been beaten were so angry, and made so  much palaver with the tortoise, that he made up his mind to return the  drum to the king the next day. So in the morning the tortoise went to  the king and brought the drum with him. He told the king that he was  not satisfied with the drum, and wished to exchange it for something  else; he did not mind so much what the king gave him so long as he got  full value for the drum, and he was quite willing to accept a certain  number of slaves, or a few farms, or their equivalent in cloth or  rods.
                  The king, however, refused to do this; but as he was rather sorry for  the tortoise, he said he would present him with a magic foo-foo tree,  which would provide the tortoise and his family with food, provided he  kept a certain condition. This the tortoise gladly consented to do.  Now this foo-foo tree only bore fruit once a year, but every day it  dropped foo-foo and soup on the ground. And the condition was, that  the owner should gather sufficient food for the day, once, and not  return again for more. The tortoise, when he had thanked the king for  his generosity, went home to his wife and told her to bring her  calabashes to the tree. She did so, and they gathered plenty of  foo-foo and soup quite sufficient for the whole family for that day,  and went back to their house very happy.
                  That night they all feasted and enjoyed themselves. But one of the  sons, who was very greedy, thought to himself&mdash;
                  &quot;I wonder where my father gets all this good food from? I must ask  him.&quot;
                  So in the morning he said to his father&mdash;
                  &quot;Tell me where do you get all this foo-foo and soup from?&quot;
                  But his father refused to tell him, as his wife, who was a cunning  woman, said&mdash;
                  &quot;If we let our children know the secret of the foo-foo tree, some day  when they are hungry, after we have got our daily supply, one of them  may go to the tree and gather more, which will break the Ju Ju.&quot;
                  But the envious son, being determined to get plenty of food for  himself, decided to track his father to the place where he obtained  the food. This was rather difficult to do, as the tortoise always went  out alone, and took the greatest care to prevent any one following  him. The boy, however, soon thought of a plan, and got a calabash with  a long neck and a hole in the end. He filled the calabash with wood  ashes, which he obtained from the fire, and then got a bag which his  father always carried on his back when he went out to get food. In the  bottom of the bag the boy then made a small hole, and inserted the  calabash with the neck downwards, so that when his father walked to  the foo-foo tree he would leave a small trail of wood ashes behind  him. Then when his father, having slung his bag over his back as  usual, set out to get the daily supply of food, his greedy son  followed the trail of the wood ashes, taking great care to hide  himself and not to let his father perceive that he was being followed.  At last the tortoise arrived at the tree, and placed his calabashes on  the ground and collected the food for the day, the boy watching him  from a distance. When his father had finished and went home the boy  also returned, and having had a good meal, said nothing to his  parents, but went to bed. The next morning he got some of his  brothers, and after his father had finished getting the daily supply,  they went to the tree and collected much foo-foo and soup, and so  broke the Ju Ju.
                  At daylight the tortoise went to the tree as usual, but he could not  find it, as during the night the whole bush had grown up, and the  foo-foo tree was hidden from sight. There was nothing to be seen but  a dense mass of prickly tie-tie palm. Then the tortoise at once knew  that some one had broken the Ju Ju, and had gathered foo-foo from the  tree twice in the same day; so he returned very sadly to his house,  and told his wife. He then called all his family together and told  them what had happened, and asked them who had done this evil thing.  They all denied having had anything to do with the tree, so the  tortoise in despair brought all his family to the place where the  foo-foo tree had been, but which was now all prickly tie-tie palm, and  said&mdash;
                  &quot;My dear wife and children, I have done all that I can for you, but  you have broken my Ju Ju; you must therefore for the future live on  the tie-tie palm.&quot;
                  So they made their home underneath the prickly tree, and from that day  you will always find tortoises living under the prickly tie-tie palm,  as they have nowhere else to go to for food.
