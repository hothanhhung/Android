                  Okun Archibong was one of King Archibong's slaves, and lived on a farm  near Calabar. He was a hunter, and used to kill bush buck and other  kinds of antelopes and many monkeys. The skins he used to dry in the  sun, and when they were properly cured, he used to sell them in the  market; the monkey skins were used for making drums, and the antelope  skins were used for sitting mats. The flesh, after it had been well  smoked over a wood fire, he also sold, but he did not make much money.
                  Okun Archibong married a slave woman of Duke's house named Nkoyo. He  paid a small dowry to the Dukes, took his wife home to his farm, and  in the dry season time she had a son. About four months after the  birth of the child Nkoyo took him to the farm while her husband was  absent hunting. She placed the little boy under a shady tree and went  about her work, which was clearing the ground for the yams which would  be planted about two months before the rains. Every day while the  mother was working a big ape used to come from the forest and play  with the little boy; he used to hold him in his arms and carry him up  a tree, and when Nkoyo had finished her work, he used to bring the  baby back to her. There was a hunter named Edem Effiong who had for a  long time been in love with Nkoyo, and had made advances to her, but  she would have nothing to do with him, as she was very fond of her  husband. When she had her little child Effiong Edem was very jealous,  and meeting her one day on the farm without her baby, he said: &quot;Where  is your baby?&quot; And she replied that a big ape had taken it up a tree  and was looking after it for her. When Effiong Edem saw that the ape  was a big one, he made up his mind to tell Nkoyo's husband. The very  next day he told Okun Archibong that he had seen his wife in the  forest with a big ape. At first Okun would not believe this, but the  hunter told him to come with him and he could see it with his own  eyes. Okun Archibong therefore made up his mind to kill the ape. The  next day he went with the other hunter to the farm and saw the ape up  a tree playing with his son, so he took very careful aim and shot the  ape, but it was not quite killed. It was so angry, and its strength  was so great, that it tore the child limb from limb and threw it to  the ground. This so enraged Okun Archibong that seeing his wife  standing near he shot her also. He then ran home and told King  Archibong what had taken place. This king was very brave and fond of  fighting, so as he knew that King Duke would be certain to make war  upon him, he immediately called in all his fighting men. When he was  quite prepared he sent a messenger to tell King Duke what had  happened. Duke was very angry, and sent the messenger back to King  Archibong to say that he must send the hunter to him, so that he could  kill him in any way he pleased. This Archibong refused to do, and  said he would rather fight. Duke then got his men together, and both  sides met and fought in the market square. Thirty men were killed of  Duke's men, and twenty were killed on Archibong's side; there were  also many wounded. On the whole King Archibong had the best of the  fighting, and drove King Duke back. When the fighting was at its  hottest the other chiefs sent out all the Egbo men with drums and  stopped the fight, and the next day the palaver was tried in Egbo  house. King Archibong was found guilty, and was ordered to pay six  thousand rods to King Duke. He refused to pay this amount to Duke, and  said he would rather go on fighting, but he did not mind paying the  six thousand rods to the town, as the Egbos had decided the case. They  were about to commence fighting again when the whole country rose up  and said they would not have any more fighting, as Archibong said to  Duke that the woman's death was not really the fault of his slave Okun  Archibong, but of Effiong Edem, who made the false report. When Duke  heard this he agreed to leave the whole matter to the chiefs to  decide, and Effiong Edem was called to take his place on the stone. He  was tried and found guilty, and two Egbos came out armed with cutting  whips and gave him two hundred lashes on his bare back, and then cut  off his head and sent it to Duke, who placed it before his Ju Ju. From  that time to the present all apes and monkeys have been frightened of  human beings; and even of little children. The Egbos also passed a law  that a chief should not allow one of his men slaves to marry a woman  slave of another house, as it would probably lead to fighting.
