                
                  There was once a woman named Affiong Any who lived at 'Nsidung, a  small town to the south of Calabar. She was married to a chief of  Hensham Town called Etim Ekeng. They had lived together for several  years, but had no children. The chief was very anxious to have a child  during his lifetime, and made sacrifices to his Ju Ju, but they had no  effect. So he went to a witch man, who told him that the reason he had  no children was that he was too rich. The chief then asked the witch  man how he should spend his money in order to get a child, and he was  told to make friends with everybody, and give big feasts, so that he  should get rid of some of his money and become poorer.
                  The chief then went home and told his wife. The next day his wife  called all her company together and gave them a big dinner, which cost  a lot of money; much food was consumed, and large quantities of tombo  were drunk. Then the chief entertained his company, which cost a lot  more money. He also wasted a lot of money in the Egbo house. When half  of his property was wasted, his wife told him that she had conceived.  The chief, being very glad, called a big play for the next day.
                  In those days all the rich chiefs of the country belonged to the  Alligator Company, and used to meet in the water. The reason they  belonged to the company was, first of all, to protect their canoes  when they went trading, and secondly, to destroy the canoes and  property of the people who did not belong to their company, and to  take their money and kill their slaves.
                  Chief Etim Ekeng was a kind man, and would not join this society,  although he was repeatedly urged to do so. After a time a son was born  to the chief, and he called him Edet Etim. The chief then called the  Egbo society together, and all the doors of the houses in the town  were shut, the markets were stopped, and the women were not allowed to  go outside their houses while the Egbo was playing. This was kept up  for several days, and cost the chief a lot of money. Then he made up  his mind that he would divide his property, and give his son half when  he became old enough. Unfortunately after three months the chief died,  leaving his sorrowing wife to look after their little child.
                  The wife then went into mourning for seven years for her husband, and  after that time she became entitled to all his property, as the late  chief had no brothers. She looked after the little boy very carefully  until he grew up, when he became a very fine, healthy young man, and  was much admired by all the pretty girls of the town; but his mother  warned him strongly not to go with them, because they would make him  become a bad man. Whenever the girls had a play they used to invite  Edet Etim, and at last he went to the play, and they made him beat  the drum for them to dance to. After much practice he became the best  drummer in the town, and whenever the girls had a play they always  called him to drum for them. Plenty of the young girls left their  husbands, and went to Edet and asked him to marry them. This made all  the young men of the town very jealous, and when they met together at  night they considered what would be the best way to kill him. At last  they decided that when Edet went to bathe they would induce the  alligators to take him. So one night, when he was washing, one  alligator seized him by the foot, and others came and seized him round  the waist. He fought very hard, but at last they dragged him into the  deep water, and took him to their home.
                  When his mother heard this, she determined to do her best to recover  her son, so she kept quite quiet until the morning.
                  When the young men saw that Edet's mother remained quiet, and did not  cry, they thought of the story of the hawk and the owl, and determined  to keep Edet alive for a few months.
                  At cockcrow the mother raised a cry, and went to the grave of her dead  husband in order to consult his spirit as to what she had better do to  recover her lost son. After a time she went down to the beach with  small young green branches in her hands, with which she beat the  water, and called upon all the Ju Jus of the Calabar River to help her  to recover her son. She then went home and got a load of rods, and  took them to a Ju Ju man in the farm. His name was Ininen Okon; he was  so called because he was very artful, and had plenty of strong Ju  Jus.
                  When the young boys heard that Edet's mother had gone to Ininen Okon,  they all trembled with fear, and wanted to return Edet, but they could  not do so, as it was against the rules of their society. The Ju Ju man  having discovered that Edet was still alive, and was being detained in  the alligators' house, told the mother to be patient. After three days  Ininen himself joined another alligators' society, and went to inspect  the young alligators' house. He found a young man whom he knew, left  on guard when all the alligators had gone to feed at the ebb of the  tide, and came back and told the mother to wait, as he would make a Ju  Ju which would cause them all to depart in seven days, and leave no  one in the house. He made his Ju Ju, and the young alligators said  that, as no one had come for Edet, they would all go at the ebb tide  to feed, and leave no one in charge of the house. When they returned  they found Edet still there, and everything as they had left it, as  Ininen had not gone that day.
                  Three days afterwards they all went away again, and this time went a  long way off, and did not return quickly. When Ininen saw that the  tide was going down he changed himself into an alligator, and swam to  the young alligators' home, where he found Edet chained to a post. He  then found an axe and cut the post, releasing the boy. But Edet,  having been in the water so long, was deaf and dumb. He then found  several loin cloths which had been left behind by the young  alligators, so he gathered them together and took them away to show to  the king, and Ininen left the place, taking Edet with him.
                  He then called the mother to see her son, but when she came the boy  could only look at her, and could not speak. The mother embraced her  boy, but he took no notice, as he did not seem capable of  understanding anything, but sat down quietly. Then the Ju Ju man told  Edet's mother that he would cure her son in a few days, so he made  several Ju Jus, and gave her son medicine, and after a time the boy  recovered his speech and became sensible again.
                  Then Edet's mother put on a mourning cloth, and pretended that her son  was dead, and did not tell the people he had come back to her. When  the young alligators returned, they found that Edet was gone, and that  some one had taken their loin cloths. They were therefore much afraid,  and made inquiries if Edet had been seen, but they could hear nothing  about him, as he was hidden in a farm, and the mother continued to  wear her mourning cloth in order to deceive them.
                  Nothing happened for six months, and they had quite forgotten all  about the matter. Affiong, the mother, then went to the chiefs of the  town, and asked them to hold a large meeting of all the people, both  young and old, at the palaver house, so that her late husband's  property might be divided up in accordance with the native custom, as  her son had been killed by the alligators.
                  The next day the chiefs called all the people together, but the mother  in the early morning took her son to a small room at the back of the  palaver house, and left him there with the seven loin cloths which the  Ju Ju man had taken from the alligators' home. When the chiefs and  all the people were seated, Affiong stood up and addressed them,  saying&mdash;
                  &quot;Chiefs and young men of my town, eight years ago my husband was a  fine young man. He married me, and we lived together for many years  without having any children. At last I had a son, but my husband died  a few months afterwards. I brought my boy up carefully, but as he was  a good drummer and dancer the young men were jealous, and had him  caught by the alligators. Is there any one present who can tell me  what my son would have become if he had lived?&quot; She then asked them  what they thought of the alligator society, which had killed so many  young men.
                  The chiefs, who had lost a lot of slaves, told her that if she could  produce evidence against any members of the society they would destroy  it at once. She then called upon Ininen to appear with her son Edet.  He came out from the room leading Edet by the hand, and placed the  bundle of loin cloths before the chiefs.
                  The young men were very much surprised when they saw Edet, and wanted  to leave the palaver house; but when they stood up to go the chiefs  told them to sit down at once, or they would receive three hundred  lashes. They then sat down, and the Ju Ju man explained how he had  gone to the alligators' home, and had brought Edet back to his mother.  He also said that he had found the seven loin cloths in the house, but  he did not wish to say anything about them, as the owners of some of  the cloths were sons of the chiefs.
                  The chiefs, who were anxious to stop the bad society, told him,  however, to speak at once and tell them everything. Then he undid the  bundle and took the cloths out one by one, at the same time calling  upon the owners to come and take them. When they came to take their  cloths, they were told to remain where they were; and they were then  told to name their company. The seven young men then gave the names of  all the members of their society, thirty-two in all. These men were  all placed in a line, and the chiefs then passed sentence, which was  that they should all be killed the next morning on the beach. So they  were then all tied together to posts, and seven men were placed as a  guard over them. They made fires and beat drums all the night.
                  Early in the morning, at about 4 a.m., the big wooden drum was placed  on the roof of the palaver house, and beaten to celebrate the death of  the evildoers, which was the custom in those days.
                  The boys were then unfastened from the posts, and had their hands tied  behind their backs, and were marched down to the beach. When they  arrived there, the head chief stood up and addressed the people. &quot;This  is a small town of which I am chief, and I am determined to stop this  bad custom, as so many men have been killed.&quot; He then told a man who  had a sharp matchet to cut off one man's head. He then told another  man who had a sharp knife to skin another young man alive. A third man  who had a heavy stick was ordered to beat another to death, and so the  chief went on and killed all the thirty-two young men in the most horrible ways he could think of. Some of them were tied to posts in  the river, and left there until the tide came up and drowned them.  Others were flogged to death.
                  After they had all been killed, for many years no one was killed by  alligators, but some little time afterwards on the road between the  beach and the town the land fell in, making a very large and deep  hole, which was said to be the home of the alligators, and the people  have ever since tried to fill it up, but have never yet been able to  do so.
