After the feast had been held and plenty of tombo had been  drunk, it was the custom of the people to make speeches. One day after  the feast the head driver ant got up and said he and his people were  stronger than any one, and that no one, not even the elephant, could  stand before him, which was quite true. He was particularly offensive  in his allusions to the worms (whom he disliked very much), and said  they were poor wriggling things.
                  The worms were very angry and complained, so the king said that the  best way to decide the question who was the stronger was for both  sides to meet on the road and fight the matter out between themselves  to a finish. He appointed the third day from the feast for the  contest, and all the people turned out to witness the battle.
                  The driver ants left their nest in the early morning in thousands and  millions, and, as is their custom, marched in a line about one inch  broad densely packed, so that it was like a dark-brown band moving  over the country. In front of the advancing column they had out their  scouts, advance guard, and flankers, and the main body followed in  their millions close behind.
                  When they came to the battlefield the moving band spread out, and as  the thousands upon thousands of ants rolled up, the whole piece of  ground was a moving mass of ants and bunches of struggling worms. The  fight was over in a very few minutes, as the worms were bitten in  pieces by the sharp pincer-like mouths of the driver ants. The few  worms who survived squirmed away and buried themselves out of sight.
                  King Eyo decided that the driver ants were easy winners, and ever  since the worms have always been afraid and have lived underground;  and if they happen to come to the surface after the rain they hide  themselves under the ground whenever anything approaches, as they fear  all people.
