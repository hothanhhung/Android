The yam crop had failed entirely, the  plantains did not bear any fruit, the ground-nuts were all shrivelled  up, and the corn never came to a head; even the palm-oil nuts did not  ripen, and the peppers and ocros also gave out.
                  The leopard, however, who lived entirely on &quot;beef,&quot; did not care for  any of these things; and although some of the animals who lived on  corn and the growing crops began to get rather skinny, he did not mind  very much. In order to save himself trouble, as everybody was  complaining of the famine, he called a meeting of all the animals and  told them that, as they all knew, he was very powerful and must have  food, that the famine did not affect him, as he only lived on flesh,  and as there were plenty of animals about he did not intend to starve.  He then told all the animals present at the meeting that if they did  not wish to be killed themselves they must bring their grandmothers to  him for food, and when they were finished he would feed off their  mothers. The animals might bring their grandmothers in succession,  and he would take them in their turn; so that, as there were many  different animals, it would probably be some time before their mothers  were eaten, by which time it was possible that the famine would be  over. But in any case, he warned them that he was determined to have  sufficient food for himself, and that if the grandmothers or mothers  were not forthcoming he would turn upon the young people themselves  and kill and eat them.
                  This, of course, the young generation, who had attended the meeting,  did not appreciate, and in order to save their own skins, agreed to  supply the leopard with his daily meal.
                  The first to appear with his aged grandmother was the squirrel. The  grandmother was a poor decrepit old thing, with a mangy tail, and the  leopard swallowed her at one gulp, and then looked round for more. In  an angry voice he growled out: &quot;This is not the proper food for me; I  must have more at once.&quot;
                  Then a bush cat pushed his old grandmother in front of the leopard,  but he snarled at her and said, &quot;Take the nasty old thing away; I want  some sweet food.&quot;
                  It was then the turn of a bush buck, and after a great deal of  hesitation a wretchedly poor and thin old doe tottered and fell in  front of the leopard, who immediately despatched her, and although the  meal was very unsatisfactory, declared that his appetite was appeased  for that day.
                  The next day a few more animals brought their old grandmothers, until  at last it became the tortoise's turn; but being very cunning, he  produced witnesses to prove that his grandmother was dead, so the  leopard excused him.
                  After a few days all the animals' grandmothers were exhausted, and it  became the turn of the mothers to supply food for the ravenous  leopard. Now although most of the young animals did not mind getting  rid of their grandmothers, whom they had scarcely even known, many of  them had very strong objections to providing their mothers, of whom  they were very fond, as food for the leopard. Amongst the strongest  objectors were the squirrel and the tortoise. The tortoise, who had  thought the whole thing out, was aware that, as every one knew that  his mother was alive (she being rather an amiable old person and  friendly with all-comers), the same excuse would not avail him a  second time. He therefore told his mother to climb up a palm tree, and  that he would provide her with food until the famine was over. He  instructed her to let down a basket every day, and said that he would  place food in it for her. The tortoise made the basket for his mother,  and attached it to a long string of tie-tie. The string was so strong  that she could haul her son up whenever he wished to visit her.
                  All went well for some days, as the tortoise used to go at daylight to  the bottom of the tree where his mother lived and place her food in  the basket; then the old lady would pull the basket up and have her  food, and the tortoise would depart on his daily round in his usual  leisurely manner.
                  In the meantime the leopard had to have his daily food, and the  squirrel's turn came first after the grandmothers had been finished,  so he was forced to produce his mother for the leopard to eat, as he  was a poor, weak thing and not possessed of any cunning. The squirrel  was, however, very fond of his mother, and when she had been eaten he  remembered that the tortoise had not produced his grandmother for the  leopard's food. He therefore determined to set a watch on the  movements of the tortoise.
                  The very next morning, while he was gathering nuts, he saw the  tortoise walking very slowly through the bush, and being high up in  the trees and able to travel very fast, had no difficulty in keeping  the tortoise in sight without being noticed. When the tortoise arrived  at the foot of the tree where his mother lived, he placed the food in  the basket which his mother had let down already by the tie-tie, and  having got into the basket and given a pull at the string to signify  that everything was right, was hauled up, and after a time was let  down again in the basket. The squirrel was watching all the time, and  directly the tortoise had gone, jumped from branch to branch of the  trees, and very soon arrived at the place where the leopard was  snoozing.
                  When he woke up, the squirrel said:
                  &quot;You have eaten my grandmother and my mother, but the tortoise has not  provided any food for you. It is now his turn, and he has hidden his  mother away in a tree.&quot;
                  At this the leopard was very angry, and told the squirrel to lead him  at once to the tree where the tortoise's mother lived. But the  squirrel said:
                  &quot;The tortoise only goes at daylight, when his mother lets down a  basket; so if you go in the morning early, she will pull you up, and  you can then kill her.&quot;
                  To this the leopard agreed, and the next morning the squirrel came at  cockcrow and led the leopard to the tree where the tortoise's mother  was hidden. The old lady had already let down the basket for her daily  supply of food, and the leopard got into it and gave the line a pull;  but except a few small jerks nothing happened, as the old mother  tortoise was not strong enough to pull a heavy leopard off the ground.  When the leopard saw that he was not going to be pulled up, being an  expert climber, he scrambled up the tree, and when he got to the top  he found the poor old tortoise, whose shell was so tough that he  thought she was not worth eating, so he threw her down on to the  ground in a violent temper, and then came down himself and went home.
                  Shortly after this the tortoise arrived at the tree, and finding the  basket on the ground gave his usual tug at it, but there was no  answer. He then looked about, and after a little time came upon the  broken shell of his poor old mother, who by this time was quite dead.  The tortoise knew at once that the leopard had killed his mother, and  made up his mind that for the future he would live alone and have  nothing to do with the other animals.
