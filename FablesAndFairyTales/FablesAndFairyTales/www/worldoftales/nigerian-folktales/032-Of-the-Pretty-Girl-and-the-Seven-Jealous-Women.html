She was a native of  Ibibio, and the name was given to her on account of her good looks, as  she was born in the spring-time. She was an only daughter, and her  parents were extremely fond of her. The people of the town, and more  particularly the young girls, were so jealous of Akim's good looks and  beautiful form&mdash;for she was perfectly made, very strong, and her  carriage, bearing, and manners were most graceful&mdash;that her parents  would not allow her to join the young girls' society in the town, as  is customary for all young people to do, both boys and girls belonging  to a company according to their age; a company consisting, as a rule,  of all the boys or girls born in the same year.
                  Akim's parents were rather poor, but she was a good daughter, and gave  them no trouble, so they had a happy home. One day as Akim was on her  way to draw water from the spring she met the company of seven girls,  to which in an ordinary way she would have belonged, if her parents  had not forbidden her. These girls told her that they were going to  hold a play in the town in three days' time, and asked her to join  them. She said she was very sorry, but that her parents were poor, and  only had herself to work for them, she therefore had no time to spare  for dancing and plays. She then left them and went home.
                  In the evening the seven girls met together, and as they were very  envious of Akim, they discussed how they should be revenged upon her  for refusing to join their company, and they talked for a long time as  to how they could get Akim into danger or punish her in some way.
                  At last one of the girls suggested that they should all go to Akim's  house every day and help her with her work, so that when they had made  friends with her they would be able to entice her away and take their  revenge upon her for being more beautiful than themselves. Although  they went every day and helped Akim and her parents with their work,  the parents knew that they were jealous of their daughter, and  repeatedly warned her not on any account to go with them, as they were  not to be trusted.
                  At the end of the year there was going to be a big play, called the  new yam play, to which Akim's parents had been invited. The play was  going to be held at a town about two hours' march from where they  lived. Akim was very anxious to go and take part in the dance, but her  parents gave her plenty of work to do before they started, thinking  that this would surely prevent her going, as she was a very obedient  daughter, and always did her work properly.
                  On the morning of the play the jealous seven came to Akim and asked  her to go with them, but she pointed to all the water-pots she had to  fill, and showed them where her parents had told her to polish the  walls with a stone and make the floor good; and after that was  finished she had to pull up all the weeds round the house and clean up  all round. She therefore said it was impossible for her to leave the  house until all the work was finished. When the girls heard this they  took up the water-pots, went to the spring, and quickly returned with  them full; they placed them in a row, and then they got stones, and  very soon had the walls polished and the floor made good; after that  they did the weeding outside and the cleaning up, and when everything  was completed they said to Akim, &quot;Now then, come along; you have no  excuse to remain behind, as all the work is done.&quot;
                  Akim really wanted to go to the play; so as all the work was done  which her parents had told her to do, she finally consented to go.  About half-way to the town, where the new yam play was being held,  there was a small river, about five feet deep, which had to be crossed  by wading, as there was no bridge. In this river there was a powerful  Ju Ju, whose law was that whenever any one crossed the river and  returned the same way on the return journey, whoever it was, had to  give some food to the Ju Ju. If they did not make the proper sacrifice  the Ju Ju dragged them down and took them to his home, and kept them  there to work for him. The seven jealous girls knew all about this Ju  Ju, having often crossed the river before, as they walked about all  over the country, and had plenty of friends in the different towns.  Akim, however, who was a good girl, and never went anywhere, knew  nothing about this Ju Ju, which her companions had found out.
                  When the work was finished they all started off together, and crossed  the river without any trouble. When they had gone a small distance on  the other side they saw a small bird, perched on a high tree, who  admired Akim very much, and sang in praise of her beauty, much to the  annoyance of the seven girls; but they walked on without saying  anything, and eventually arrived at the town where the play was being  held. Akim had not taken the trouble to change her clothes, but when  she arrived at the town, although her companions had on all their best  beads and their finest clothes, the young men and people admired Akim  far more than the other girls, and she was declared to be the finest  and most beautiful woman at the dance. They gave her plenty of palm  wine, foo-foo, and everything she wanted, so that the seven girls  became more angry and jealous than before. The people danced and sang  all that night, but Akim managed to keep out of the sight of her  parents until the following morning, when they asked her how it was  that she had disobeyed them and neglected her work; so Akim told them  that the work had all been done by her friends, and they had enticed  her to come to the play with them. Her mother then told her to return  home at once, and that she was not to remain in the town any longer.
                  When Akim told her friends this they said, &quot;Very well, we are just  going to have some small meal, and then we will return with you.&quot; They  all then sat down together and had their food, but each of the seven  jealous girls hid a small quantity of foo-foo and fish in her clothes  for the Water Ju Ju. However Akim, who knew nothing about this, as her  parents had forgotten to tell her about the Ju Ju, never thinking for  one moment that their daughter would cross the river, did not take any  food as a sacrifice to the Ju Ju with her.
                  When they arrived at the river Akim saw the girls making their small  sacrifices, and begged them to give her a small share so that she  could do the same, but they refused, and all walked across the river  safely. Then when it was Akim's turn to cross, when she arrived in the  middle of the river, the Water Ju Ju caught hold of her and dragged  her underneath the water, so that she immediately disappeared from  sight. The seven girls had been watching for this, and when they saw  that she had gone they went on their way, very pleased at the success  of their scheme, and said to one another, &quot;Now Akim is gone for ever,  and we shall hear no more about her being better-looking than we are.&quot;
                  As there was no one to be seen at the time when Akim disappeared they  naturally thought that their cruel action had escaped detection, so  they went home rejoicing; but they never noticed the little bird high  up in the tree who had sung of Akim's beauty when they were on their  way to the play. The little bird was very sorry for Akim, and made up  his mind that, when the proper time came, he would tell her parents  what he had seen, so that perhaps they would be able to save her. The  bird had heard Akim asking for a small portion of the food to make a  sacrifice with, and had heard all the girls refusing to give her any.
                  The following morning, when Akim's parents returned home, they were  much surprised to find that the door was fastened, and that there was  no sign of their daughter anywhere about the place, so they inquired  of their neighbours, but no one was able to give them any information  about her. They then went to the seven girls, and asked them what had  become of Akim. They replied that they did not know what had become of  her, but that she had reached their town safely with them, and then  said she was going home. The father then went to his Ju Ju man, who,  by casting lots, discovered what had happened, and told him that on  her way back from the play Akim had crossed the river without making  the customary sacrifice to the Water Ju Ju, and that, as the Ju Ju was  angry, he had seized Akim and taken her to his home. He therefore told  Akim's father to take one goat, one basketful of eggs, and one piece  of white cloth to the river in the morning, and to offer them as a  sacrifice to the Water Ju Ju; then Akim would be thrown out of the  water seven times, but that if her father failed to catch her on the  seventh time, she would disappear for ever.
                  Akim's father then returned home, and, when he arrived there, the  little bird who had seen Akim taken by the Water Ju Ju, told him  everything that had happened, confirming the Ju Ju's words. He also  said that it was entirely the fault of the seven girls, who had  refused to give Akim any food to make the sacrifice with.
                  Early the following morning the parents went to the river, and made  the sacrifice as advised by the Ju Ju. Immediately they had done so,  the Water Ju Ju threw Akim up from the middle of the river. Her  father caught her at once, and returned home very thankfully.
                  He never told any one, however, that he had recovered his daughter,  but made up his mind to punish the seven jealous girls, so he dug a  deep pit in the middle of his house, and placed dried palm leaves and  sharp stakes in the bottom of the pit. He then covered the top of the  pit with new mats, and sent out word for all people to come and hold a  play to rejoice with him, as he had recovered his daughter from the  spirit land. Many people came, and danced and sang all the day and  night, but the seven jealous girls did not appear, as they were  frightened. However, as they were told that everything had gone well  on the previous day, and that there had been no trouble, they went to  the house the following morning and mixed with the dancers; but they  were ashamed to look Akim in the face, who was sitting down in the  middle of the dancing ring.
                  When Akim's father saw the seven girls he pretended to welcome them as  his daughter's friends, and presented each of them with a brass rod,  which he placed round their necks. He also gave them tombo to drink.
                  He then picked them out, and told them to go and sit on mats on the  other side of the pit he had prepared for them. When they walked over  the mats which hid the pit they all fell in, and Akim's father  immediately got some red-hot ashes from the fire and threw them in on  top of the screaming girls, who were in great pain. At once the dried  palm leaves caught fire, killing all the girls at once.
                  When the people heard the cries and saw the smoke, they all ran back  to the town.
                  The next day the parents of the dead girls went to the head chief, and  complained that Akim's father had killed their daughters, so the chief  called him before him, and asked him for an explanation.
                  Akim's father went at once to the chief, taking the Ju Ju man, whom  everybody relied upon, and the small bird, as his witnesses.
                  When the chief had heard the whole case, he told Akim's father that he  should only have killed one girl to avenge his daughter, and not  seven. So he told the father to bring Akim before him.
                  When she arrived, the head chief, seeing how beautiful she was, said  that her father was justified in killing all the seven girls on her  behalf, so he dismissed the case, and told the parents of the dead  girls to go away and mourn for their daughters, who had been wicked  and jealous women, and had been properly punished for their cruel  behaviour to Akim.
                  Moral.&mdash;Never kill a man or a woman because you are envious of their  beauty, as if you do, you will surely be punished.
