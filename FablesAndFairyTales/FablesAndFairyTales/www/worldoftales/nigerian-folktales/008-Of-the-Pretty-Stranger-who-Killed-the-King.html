All the prisoners he took were made slaves. He therefore became very  rich, but, on the other hand, he had many enemies. The people of Itu  in particular were very angry with him and wanted to kill him, but  they were not strong enough to beat Mbotu in a pitched battle, so they  had to resort to craft. The Itu people had an old woman who was a  witch and could turn herself into whatever she pleased, and when she  offered to kill Mbotu, the people were very glad, and promised her  plenty of money and cloth if she succeeded in ridding them of their  worst enemy. The witch then turned herself into a young and pretty  girl, and having armed herself with a very sharp knife, which she  concealed in her bosom, she went to Old Town, Calabar, to seek the  king.
                  It happened that when she arrived there was a big play being held in  the town, and all the people from the surrounding country had come in  to dance and feast. Oyaikan, the witch, went to the play, and walked  about so that every one could see her. Directly she appeared the  people all marvelled at her beauty, and said that she was as  beautiful as the setting sun when all the sky was red. Word was  quickly brought to king Mbotu, who, it was well known, was fond of  pretty girls, and he sent for her at once, all the people agreeing  that she was quite worthy of being the king's wife. When she appeared  before him he fancied her so much, that he told her he would marry her  that very day. Oyaikan was very pleased at this, as she had never  expected to get her opportunity so quickly. She therefore prepared a  dainty meal for the king, into which she placed a strong medicine to  make the king sleep, and then went down to the river to wash.
                  When she had finished it was getting dark, so she went to the king's  compound, carrying her dish on her head, and was at once shown in to  the king, who embraced her affectionately. She then offered him the  food, which she said, quite truly, she had prepared with her own  hands. The king ate the whole dish, and immediately began to feel very  sleepy, as the medicine was strong and took effect quickly.
                  They retired to the king's chamber, and the king went to sleep at  once. About midnight, when all the town was quiet, Oyaikan drew her  knife from her bosom and cut the king's head off. She put the head in  a bag and went out very softly, shutting and barring the door behind  her. Then she walked through the town without any one observing her,  and went straight to Itu, where she placed king Mbotu's head before  her own king.
                  When the people heard that the witch had been successful and that  their enemy was dead, there was great rejoicing, and the king of Itu  at once made up his mind to attack Old Town, Calabar. He therefore  got his fighting men together and took them in canoes by the creeks to  Old Town, taking care that no one carried word to Calabar that he was  coming.
                  The morning following the murder of Mbotu his people were rather  surprised that he did not appear at his usual time, so his head wife  knocked at his door. Not receiving any answer she called the household  together, and they broke open the door. When they entered the room  they found the king lying dead on his bed covered in blood, but his  head was missing. At this a great shout went up, and the whole town  mourned. Although they missed the pretty stranger, they never  connected her in their minds with the death of their king, and were  quite unsuspicious of any danger, and were unprepared for fighting. In  the middle of the mourning, while they were all dancing, crying, and  drinking palm wine, the king of Itu with all his soldiers attacked Old  Town, taking them quite by surprise, and as their leader was dead, the  Calabar people were very soon defeated, and many killed and taken  prisoners.
                  Moral.&mdash;Never marry a stranger, no matter how pretty she may be.
