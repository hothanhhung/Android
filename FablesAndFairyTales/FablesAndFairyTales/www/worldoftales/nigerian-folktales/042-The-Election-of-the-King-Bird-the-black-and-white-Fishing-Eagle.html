He  therefore used to call upon the animals and birds to help his people  with their work. In order to get the work done quickly and well, he  determined to appoint head chiefs of all the different species. The  elephant he appointed king of the beasts of the forest, and the  hippopotamus king of the water animals, until at last it came to the  turn of the birds to have their king elected.
                  Essiya thought for some time which would be the best way to make a  good choice, but could not make up his mind, as there were so many  different birds who all considered they had claims. There was the hawk  with his swift flight, and of hawks there were several species. There  were the herons to be considered, and the big spur-winged geese, the  hornbill or toucan tribe, and the game birds, such as guinea-fowl, the  partridge, and the bustards. Then again, of course, there were all the  big crane tribe, who walked about the sandbanks in the dry season,  but who disappeared when the river rose, and the big black-and-white  fishing eagles. When the king thought of the plover tribe, the  sea-birds, including the pelicans, the doves, and the numerous shy  birds who live in the forest, all of whom sent in claims, he got so  confused, that he decided to have a trial by ordeal of combat, and  sent word round the whole country for all the birds to meet the next  day and fight it out between themselves, and that the winner should be  known as the king bird ever afterwards.
                  The following morning many thousands of birds came, and there was much  screeching and flapping of wings. The hawk tribe soon drove all the  small birds away, and harassed the big waders so much, that they very  shortly disappeared, followed by the geese, who made much noise, and  winged away in a straight line, as if they were playing &quot;Follow my  leader.&quot; The big forest birds who liked to lead a secluded life very  soon got tired of all the noise and bustle, and after a few croaks and  other weird noises went home. The game birds had no chance and hid in  the bush, so that very soon the only birds left were the hawks and the  big black-and-white fishing eagle, who was perched on a tree calmly  watching everything. The scavenger hawks were too gorged and lazy to  take much interest in the proceedings, and were quietly ignored by the  fighting tribe, who were very busy circling and swooping on one  another, with much whistling going on. Higher and higher they went,  until they disappeared out of sight. Then a few would return to earth,  some of them badly torn and with many feathers missing.
                  At last the fishing eagle said&mdash;
                  &quot;When you have quite finished with this foolishness please tell me,  and if any of you fancy yourselves at all, come to me, and I will  settle your chances of being elected head chief once and for all;&quot; but  when they saw his terrible beak and cruel claws, knowing his great  strength and ferocity, they stopped fighting between themselves, and  acknowledged the fishing eagle to be their master.
                  Essiya then declared that Ituen, which was the name of the fishing  eagle, was the head chief of all the birds, and should thenceforward  be known as the king bird.
                  From that time to the present day, whenever the young men of the  country go to fight they always wear three of the long black-and-white  feathers of the king bird in their hair, one on each side and one in  the middle, as they are believed to impart much courage and skill to  the wearer; and if a young man is not possessed of any of these  feathers when he goes out to fight, he is looked upon as a very small  boy indeed.
