The  Creator was a big chief, past all men, and being very kind-hearted,  was very sorry whenever any one died. So one day he sent for the dog,  who was his head messenger, and told him to go out into the world and  give his word to all people that for the future whenever any one died  the body was to be placed in the compound, and wood ashes were to be  thrown over it; that the dead body was to be left on the ground, and  in twenty-four hours it would become alive again.
                  When the dog had travelled for half a day he began to get tired; so as  he was near an old woman's house he looked in, and seeing a bone with  some meat on it he made a meal off it, and then went to sleep,  entirely forgetting the message which had been given him to deliver.
                  After a time, when the dog did not return, the Creator called for a  sheep, and sent him out with the same message. But the sheep was a  very foolish one, and being hungry, began eating the sweet grasses by  the wayside. After a time, however, he remembered that he had a  message to deliver, but forgot what it was exactly; so as he went  about among the people he told them that the message the Creator had  given him to tell the people, was that whenever any one died they  should be buried underneath the ground.
                  A little time afterwards the dog remembered his message, so he ran  into the town and told the people that they were to place wood ashes  on the dead bodies and leave them in the compound, and that they would  come to life again after twenty-four hours. But the people would not  believe him, and said, &quot;We have already received the word from the  Creator by the sheep, that all dead bodies should be buried.&quot; In  consequence of this the dead bodies are now always buried, and the dog  is much disliked and not trusted as a messenger, as if he had not  found the bone in the old woman's house and forgotten his message, the  dead people might still be alive.
