She was very  beautiful, and many young men applied to the parents for permission to  marry their daughter, and offered dowry, but the mother always  refused, as she said it was impossible for her daughter to work on a  farm, as she would melt in the sun. At last a stranger came from a  far-distant country and fell in love with the fat woman, and he  promised if her mother would hand her to him that he would keep her in  the shade. At last the mother agreed, and he took his wife away.
                  When he arrived at his house, his other wife immediately became very  jealous, because when there was work to be done, firewood to be  collected, or water to be carried, the fat woman stayed at home and  never helped, as she was frightened of the heat.
                  One day when the husband was absent, the jealous wife abused the fat  woman so much that she finally agreed to go and work on the farm,  although her little sister, whom she had brought from home with her,  implored her not to go, reminding her that their mother had always  told them ever since they were born that she would melt away if she  went into the sun. All the way to the farm the fat woman managed to  keep in the shade, and when they arrived at the farm the sun was very  hot, so the fat woman remained in the shade of a big tree. When the  jealous wife saw this she again began abusing her, and asked her why  she did not do her share of the work. At last she could stand the  nagging no longer, and although her little sister tried very hard to  prevent her, the fat woman went out into the sun to work, and  immediately began to melt away. There was very soon nothing left of  her but one big toe, which had been covered by a leaf. This her little  sister observed, and with tears in her eyes she picked up the toe,  which was all that remained of the fat woman, and having covered it  carefully with leaves, placed it in the bottom of her basket. When she  arrived at the house the little sister placed the toe in an earthen  pot, filled it with water, and covered the top up with clay.
                  When the husband returned, he said, &quot;Where is my fat wife?&quot; and the  little sister, crying bitterly, told him that the jealous woman had  made her go out into the sun, and that she had melted away. She then  showed him the pot with the remains of her sister, and told him that  her sister would come to life again in three months' time quite  complete, but he must send away the jealous wife, so that there should  be no more trouble; if he refused to do this, the little girl said she  would take the pot back to their mother, and when her sister became  complete again they would remain at home.
                  The husband then took the jealous wife back to her parents, who sold  her as a slave and paid the dowry back to the husband, so that he  could get another wife. When he received the money, the husband took  it home and kept it until the three months had elapsed, when the  little sister opened the pot and the fat woman emerged, quite as fat  and beautiful as she had been before. The husband was so delighted  that he gave a feast to all his friends and neighbours, and told them  the whole story of the bad behaviour of his jealous wife.
                  Ever since that time, whenever a wife behaves very badly the husband  returns her to the parents, who sell the woman as a slave, and out of  the proceeds of the sale reimburse the husband the amount of dowry  which he paid when he married the girl.
