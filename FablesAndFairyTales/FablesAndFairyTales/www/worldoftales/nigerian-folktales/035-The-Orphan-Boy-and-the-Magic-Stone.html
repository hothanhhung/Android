                
                  A chief of Inde named Inkita had a son named Ayong Kita, whose mother  had died at his birth.
                  The old chief was a hunter, and used to take his son out with him when  he went into the bush. He used to do most of his hunting in the long  grass which grows over nearly all the Inde country, and used to kill  plenty of bush buck in the dry season.
                  In those days the people had no guns, so the chief had to shoot  everything he got with his bow and arrows, which required a lot of  skill.
                  When his little son was old enough, he gave him a small bow and some  small arrows, and taught him how to shoot. The little boy was very  quick at learning, and by continually practising at lizards and small  birds, soon became expert in the use of his little bow, and could hit  them almost every time he shot at them.
                  When the boy was ten years old his father died, and as he thus became  the head of his father's house, and was in authority over all the  slaves, they became very discontented, and made plans to kill him, so  he ran away into the bush.
                  Having nothing to eat, he lived for several days on the nuts which  fell from the palm trees. He was too young to kill any large animals,  and only had his small bow and arrows, with which he killed a few  squirrels, bush rats, and small birds, and so managed to live.
                  Now once at night, when he was sleeping in the hollow of a tree, he  had a dream in which his father appeared, and told him where there was  plenty of treasure buried in the earth, but, being a small boy, he was  frightened, and did not go to the place.
                  One day, some time after the dream, having walked far and being very  thirsty, he went to a lake, and was just going to drink, when he heard  a hissing sound, and heard a voice tell him not to drink. Not seeing  any one, he was afraid, and ran away without drinking.
                  Early next morning, when he was out with his bow trying to shoot some  small animal, he met an old woman with quite long hair. She was so  ugly that he thought she must be a witch, so he tried to run, but she  told him not to fear, as she wanted to help him and assist him to rule  over his late father's house. She also told him that it was she who  had called out to him at the lake not to drink, as there was a bad Ju  Ju in the water which would have killed him. The old woman then took  Ayong to a stream some little distance from the lake, and bending  down, took out a small shining stone from the water, which she gave to  him, at the same time telling him to go to the place which his father  had advised him to visit in his dream. She then said, &quot;When you get  there you must dig, and you will find plenty of money; you must then  go and buy two strong slaves, and when you have got them, you must  take them into the forest, away from the town, and get them to build  you a house with several rooms in it. You must then place the stone in  one of the rooms, and whenever you want anything, all you have to do  is to go into the room and tell the stone what you want, and your  wishes will be at once gratified.&quot;
                  Ayong did as the old woman told him, and after much difficulty and  danger bought the two slaves and built a house in the forest, taking  great care of the precious stone, which he placed in an inside room.  Then for some time, whenever he wanted anything, he used to go into  the room and ask for a sufficient number of rods to buy what he  wanted, and they were always brought at once.
                  This went on for many years, and Ayong grew up to be a man, and became  very rich, and bought many slaves, having made friends with the Aro  men, who in those days used to do a big traffic in slaves. After ten  years had passed Ayong had quite a large town and many slaves, but one  night the old woman appeared to him in a dream and told him that she  thought that he was sufficiently wealthy, and that it was time for him  to return the magic stone to the small stream from whence it came. But  Ayong, although he was rich, wanted to rule his father's house and be  a head chief for all the Inde country, so he sent for all the Ju Ju  men in the country and two witch men, and marched with all his slaves  to his father's town. Before he started he held a big palaver, and  told them to point out any slave who had a bad heart, and who might  kill him when he came to rule the country. Then the Ju Ju men consulted together, and pointed out fifty of the slaves who, they  said, were witches, and would try to kill Ayong. He at once had them  made prisoners, and tried them by the ordeal of Esere bean (strong poison) to see  whether they were witches or not. As none of them could vomit the  beans they all died, and were declared to be witches. He then had them  buried at once. When the remainder of his slaves saw what had  happened, they all came to him and begged his pardon, and promised to  serve him faithfully. Although the fifty men were buried they could  not rest, and troubled Ayong very much, and after a time he became  very sick himself, so he sent again for the Ju Ju men, who told him  that it was the witch men who, although they were dead and buried, had  power to come out at night and used to suck Ayong's blood, which was  the cause of his sickness. They then said, &quot;We are only three Ju Ju  men; you must get seven more of us, making the magic number of ten.&quot;  When they came they dug up the bodies of the fifty witches, and found  they were quite fresh. Then Ayong had big fires made, and burned them  one after the other, and gave the Ju Ju men a big present. He soon  after became quite well again, and took possession of his father's  property, and ruled over all the country.                  
                  Ever since then, whenever any one is accused of being a witch, they  are tried by the ordeal of the poisonous Esere bean, and if they can  vomit they do not die, and are declared innocent, but if they cannot  do so, they die in great pain.
