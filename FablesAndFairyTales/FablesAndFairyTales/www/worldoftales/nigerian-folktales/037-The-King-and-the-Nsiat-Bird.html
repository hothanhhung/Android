The 'Nsiat bird was then  living at Idu, and had a very pretty daughter, whom 'Ndarake wished to  marry. When he spoke to the father about the matter, he replied that  of course he had no objection personally, as it would be a great  honour for his daughter to marry the king, but, unfortunately, when  any of his family had children, they always gave birth to twins,  which, as the king knew, was not allowed in the country; the native  custom being to kill both the children and throw them into the bush,  the mother being driven away and allowed to starve. The king, however,  being greatly struck with Adit, the bird's daughter, insisted on  marrying her, so the 'Nsiat bird had to agree. A large amount of dowry  was paid by the king, and a big play and feast was held. One strong  slave was told to carry Adit 'Nsiat during the whole play, and she sat  on his shoulders with her legs around his neck; this was done to show  what a rich and powerful man the king was.
                  After the marriage, in due course Adit gave birth to twins, as her  mother had done before her. The king immediately became very fond of  the two babies, but according to the native custom, which was too  strong for any one to resist, he had to give them up to be killed.  When the 'Nsiat bird heard this, he went to the king and reminded him  that he had warned the king before he married what would happen if he  married Adit, and rather than that the twins should be killed, he and  the whole of his family would leave the earth and dwell in the air,  taking the twins with them. As the king was so fond of Adit and the  two children, and did not want them to be killed, he gladly consented,  and the 'Nsiat bird took the whole of his family, as well as Adit and  her two children, away, and left the earth to live and make their home  in the trees; but as they had formerly lived in the town with all the  people, they did not like to go into the forest, so they made their  nests in the trees which grew in the town, and that is why you always  see the 'Nsiat birds living and making their nests only in places  where human beings are. The black birds are the cocks, and the  golden-coloured ones are the hens. It was the beautiful colour of Adit  which first attracted the attention of 'Ndarake and caused him to  marry her.
