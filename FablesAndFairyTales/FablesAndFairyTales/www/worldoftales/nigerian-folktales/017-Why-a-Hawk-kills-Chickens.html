                  One day a hawk was hovering round, about eleven o'clock in the  morning, as was his custom, making large circles in the air and  scarcely moving his wings. His keen eyes were wide open, taking in  everything (for nothing moving ever escapes the eyes of a hawk, no  matter how small it may be or how high up in the air the hawk may be  circling). This hawk saw the pretty hen picking up some corn near her  father's house. He therefore closed his wings slightly, and in a  second of time was close to the ground; then spreading his wings out  to check his flight, he alighted close to the hen and perched himself  on the fence, as a hawk does not like to walk on the ground if he can  help it.
                  He then greeted the young hen with his most enticing whistle, and  offered to marry her. She agreed, so the hawk spoke to the parents,  and paid the agreed amount of dowry, which consisted mostly of corn,  and the next day took the young hen off to his home.
                  Shortly after this a young cock who lived near the hen's former home  found out where she was living, and having been in love with her for  some months&mdash;in fact, ever since his spurs had grown&mdash;determined to  try and make her return to her own country. He therefore went at dawn,  and, having flapped his wings once or twice, crowed in his best voice  to the young hen. When she heard the sweet voice of the cock she could  not resist his invitation, so she went out to him, and they walked off  together to her parent's house, the young cock strutting in front  crowing at intervals.
                  The hawk, who was hovering high up in the sky, quite out of sight of  any ordinary eye, saw what had happened, and was very angry. He made  up his mind at once that he would obtain justice from the king, and  flew off to Calabar, where he told the whole story, and asked for  immediate redress. So the king sent for the parents of the hen, and  told them they must repay to the hawk the amount of dowry they had  received from him on the marriage of their daughter, according to the  native custom; but the hen's parents said that they were so poor that  they could not possibly afford to pay. So the king told the hawk that  he could kill and eat any of the cock's children whenever and wherever  he found them as payment of his dowry, and, if the cock made any  complaint, the king would not listen to him.
                  From that time until now, whenever a hawk sees a chicken he swoops  down and carries it off in part-payment of his dowry.
