           Overlooking the river Douro, close  to Freixo, are some huge rocks, situated  on the brink of an almost perpendicular eminence.  To this spot do congregate, so it is  reported, the souls of unbaptized children, who  make the midnight hour hideous with their  shrieks when the tempest is hurrying down  through the valley and over the snow-capped  hills. When the wind is at its highest do these  souls of the lost utter their weird shrieks, so  nigh akin unto the howling of the wind that  only the neighbouring villagers pretend to be  able to distinguish between the clamouring  voices of the unbaptized and the howling  caused by the fitful gusts of the wintry blast  as it rushes impetuously among the rocks and  down the precipices.
          On such nights will the farmer&rsquo;s wife light the tapers around the image of good St. Laurence,  patron of the winds, and calling her  household around her, the following verses are  intoned&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Good St. Laurence, keep us free
              From the sin of heresy;
              Lull the angry winds to rest,
              Still be thou our honoured guest,
              By our fathers prized.
            
             &ldquo;Drive all goblins from our door,
              Those whom Heaven doth ignore&mdash;
              Witches, demons, bogeys all,
              May they sink and may they fall
              With the unbaptized.&rdquo;
            
          
          At times it takes longer to appease the wrath  of St. Laurence than at others; but with daylight  the courage of the worshippers revives,  and the souls of the unbaptized seek rest,  although the winds may continue to howl.
          Many centuries ago the palace of the now  enchanted Moors at Freixo was the glory of  the place. Although considerably smaller, it  was after the style of the Alhambra, at Granada;  but it was held in almost greater esteem than  the principal residence of the Moorish kings,  for in a magnificent stable was lodged the ass  on which the prophet Mohamed was supposed to have ascended to Paradise. It seems that  the chosen quadruped, unaccustomed to the  pastures of the Mohamedan Paradise, had  escaped, and descended on earth close to the  palace, or alcazar, at Freixo, where he was  found one morning by the dwellers when they  were on their way to the mosque.
          He was a fine specimen of an ass, and  worthy of the Mohamedan creed. Tradition  hints at a miller having laid claim to him; but  as he could offer no proofs why the ass should  not have been in Paradise, and seeing that the  ass was as white as the prophet&rsquo;s, the miller  was ordered to look for his donkey elsewhere,  as this was the ass of the prophet.
          How long this favoured quadruped lived is  not recorded, but no doubts have been raised  as to his eventual demise; and he, too, was  heard braying furiously from his resting-place  when the winds blew high.
          But few vestiges are now left of this once  splendid alcazar. Time defied its ornamental  turrets and richly chased walls, and levelled  them with the ground. Only the surrounding  rocks have remained, and with them many  traditions. These the inhabitants of the district  have preserved intact, or maybe added to their interest by investing them with a semblance to  truth which renders them all the more worthy  of preservation, as being stepping-stones carrying  us back to a long past.
          But even where such doubtful lore holds the  people in awe, a few may be found who,  although rejecting that part of the tradition  which is evidently but the fruit of a fertile  imagination, or of religious fanaticism, recognize  in these legends the preservation of a still  unwritten history, to whose identification with  facts the ruins of many a Moslem building of  rare architectural beauty attest.
          And if, after many a sanguinary fight, the  Cross was victorious over the Crescent, the  Christian population of the Iberic Peninsula  must admit that the faint vestiges of beauty in  their architecture of to-day have an Arabic  origin; that to their Moorish conquerors they  owe much of the daring and endurance which  characterized the generation of great navigators,  as also to them was due the introduction of  many of the useful arts and sciences.
          The traveller will now look in vain for the  alcazar of El Rachid at Freixo. The mighty  rocks alone mark the spot, and naught remains  of art to please the eye. Traditionary lore may interest him, but he must be ready to listen to  it with all the additions which a gross superstition  can alone invent or believe.
          Here, then, is it recorded that Al Rachid  held a Christian maiden captive for many years.  That she was as good as she was beautiful goes  without further remark. Maria das Dores, for  so she is named by her chroniclers, was one  of those splendid women worthy to be the  mothers of that succeeding generation of heroes  who overthrew the Moors on the plains of  Ourique.
          Maria was the daughter of a very wealthy  farmer who resided close to the mouth of the  river Minho. It was her duty to work with  the farm labourers in the field, and she would  mingle her sweet voice with theirs when singing  hymns to the Virgin as they plied their  hoes.
          Often had Al Rachid seen her at work from  his hiding-place in a neighbouring forest. He  loved the maiden, although he had reason to  believe she was a Christian; but he knew that  she had given her love to another, and could,  therefore, not be his unless he took her by  force.
          One day, at vesper-time, she did not return to the farm with the labourers. Search was  made for her everywhere, but she could not  be found. Then it was imagined she might  be in conversation with her lover; but, on  inquiry, he had not seen her.
          Mounted parties scoured the country all  around, but in vain; she had not been seen,  and there was no doubt entertained but that  she had been lured into the forest, and become  the captive of Al Rachid.
          But, then, nobody had seen the Moorish chief  that day. True; but the Moors were enchanters,  and it was known that they could make subterranean  passages which closed behind them  so as to prevent their being pursued.
          The wise woman of the district was therefore  called into requisition, and she, having  consulted the astrolabe and made a fire of pine  needles, discovered the direction in which the  fugitives were going. Mounting their horses,  and led by the wise woman, who bestrode a  splendid white mule, they galloped off, and  after two days&rsquo; hard riding they distinctly heard  the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs, but they could not  see the horse.
          Then they knew that Al Rachid was making  use of the enchanted passage which they could not hope to find, and they had to content themselves  with following the sound until they came  within sight of Al Rachid&rsquo;s palace.
          They were now in the enemy&rsquo;s country, and  with their little force they could not successfully  besiege the palace, so, much against their will,  they returned home.
          There was only one means of rescuing the  captive maiden, and this would take time. No  Christian man or woman could gain admittance  to the enchanted passage, and no Moslem could  be found willing to attempt the rescue. Therefore  they hit upon a plan of securing the services  of a heretic. A child had been born in the  village, and him, it was resolved, they should  not baptize. When old enough, he should be  entrusted with the task of rescue, and being  unbaptized he would gain admittance to all the  enchanted places.
          Years rolled by, and the youth had attained  the age of thirteen, when he was informed of  the mission on which it was intended to send  him. Being of a daring disposition, he courted  danger, and buckling on his sword, and bearing  his shield, he left the farmer&rsquo;s house; and,  accompanied by the wise woman, he directed  his steps to the forest. When the two had reached an old oak-tree, the wise woman  repeated the following words three times&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Here stands an unbaptized
              To thread the subterranean way;&rdquo;
            
          
          and then she knocked with her staff three times  on the ground, which opened, and the youthful  heretic boldly descended, the earth closing  above him. Before him was a magnificent  display of jewels studding the walls on each  side, whose brilliancy at first dazzled him.  Getting more accustomed to the strong light,  he discovered a coal-black horse, fully caparisoned,  standing by his side, as if ready for him  to mount; but he was not to be tempted, for  he would rather trust to his legs than to a  strange horse. Then when he had walked  some distance he came to a river, on which  there was a boat rowed by six lovely maidens,  who asked him to get in, and they would row  him across. But he would not be tempted,  and he boldly waded the stream and crossed  over. Having proceeded a little further, however,  he heard the piteous cry of a child, and,  hastening forward, he saw a lovely little boy,  dressed in the Oriental fashion, who besought  him, with tears in his eyes, to carry him a little  way, for he was very tired and had still a long way to go. He could not refuse him, and,  stooping slightly, raised him in his arms; but  no sooner had he done so, than this little boy  turned into a giant, who, twining his arms  around the heretic&rsquo;s neck, would have strangled  him, but that, being unbaptized, he could not be  killed. After many attempts to strangle the  intruder the giant relaxed his hold, and as  suddenly disappeared.
          The heretic, after a time, came to a standstill,  for he was confronted by total darkness.  Nothing daunted, however, he drew his sword  and hit out, so that the blade, striking against  the sides of the passage, caused the jewels to  emit sparks, and these lit up thousands of lamps.  In the distance he saw two enormous tigers,  each having two heads. They seemed to be  ready to tear him to pieces, but, on observing  him advance sword in hand, they ran away.
          At the end of the third day he had walked  so quickly that he stood before the secret  entrance to the alcazar of Al Rachid. The  ponderous gates were wide open, but he could  not enter because of an enormous frog that  blocked up the way, and emitted flames of fire  from its mouth and eyes. Do what he could,  there was no getting near the hideous creature.
          He had recourse to stratagem, and, pretending  not to be afraid of the animal, he threw his  sword over the frog&rsquo;s back, exclaiming, &ldquo;Take  that; I fear thee not!&rdquo;
          The frog, turning to get hold of the sword,  offered an opportunity to the heretic of jumping  on its back, which he did, and, digging his spurs  into its sides, he obliged it to advance, when,  as it passed by his sword, he dexterously picked  it up, and was not at all particular how he  used it about the creature&rsquo;s head.
          The more he struck at the frog, the more  fierce were the flames of fire it emitted; and  Al Rachid, hearing the noise, hurried to the  entrance to see what was the matter, when he  found himself enveloped in flames which the  heretic forced the frog to throw out until  the cruel Moor was completely burned.
          Then at one stroke he cut off the animal&rsquo;s  head, and at the same moment the castle  vanished, and where it had previously stood  the heretic found Maria, the farmer&rsquo;s daughter,  who was overjoyed at her deliverance.
          The two wended their way back to their  native village, where great rejoicings awaited  them; and seeing that the services of the heretic  would in all probability no longer be required, he was baptized with as little delay as possible,  and for the rescue he had effected the rich  farmer amply rewarded him, while the Church  accorded him plenary absolution for his past  heresy.
