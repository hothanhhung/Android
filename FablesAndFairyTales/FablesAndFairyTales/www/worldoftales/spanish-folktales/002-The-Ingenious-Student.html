          There was once a student in Tuy who  was so very poor that, if faith in Providence  be not reckoned, he possessed no riches.
          But Juan Rivas was endowed with a wonderfully  fine gift of ingenuity, and although he  was somewhat behind in the payment for the  Masses on behalf of his predecessors, and even  more so with his mundane creditors, still was  he a man who meant well and would do the  right thing if he only had the opportunity.
          To the man of the world there is no greater  pleasure than to pay his debts, for by so doing  he increases his credit.
          Juan Rivas would willingly have paid every creditor had his pocket been as full of the  wherewithal as his heart was of gratitude for  small mercies; but there is no difficulty about  showing one&rsquo;s self desirous of satisfying one&rsquo;s  debts&mdash;the only difficulty generally rests in  being able to do so.
          At college he had proved himself a good  scholar and a true companion; but as he could  no longer contribute toward the support of his  college, his college could not be expected to  support him.
          His long black cap, his flowing robes, his  pantaloons, and his shoes were altered in substance,  and so was Juan Rivas.
          Finally he became reduced to his last maravedi,  and as his friends could no longer assist  him, he thought it was high time he should  assist himself.
          &ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has never intended  me for a poor man, but Fate has almost made  me one. I will believe in Providence, and  become rich from this day.&rdquo; Saying which, he  went to some of his companions, who were  almost as poor as he was, and asked them if  they desired to be rich.
          &ldquo;Do you ask us if we want to be rich with  so serious a face?&rdquo; answered they. &ldquo;Really, friend Juan, you are so strange that you do not  seem to belong to this city!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;No man can be rich,&rdquo; continued Juan, &ldquo;by  staying at home. We are students, and our  studies should meet with some recompense.  Will you do as I bid you?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried all his poor companions; &ldquo;so  long as you lead us not to the gallows, for we  like not such playthings.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Well, then, follow me,&rdquo; said Juan; &ldquo;and  when you see me release a prize that belongs  to him who shall be bold enough to seize it,  off with it to the market, and dispose of it at  the best possible price.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Done, and agreed to,&rdquo; shouted all, &ldquo;if  you will but seize the prize!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said the poor student,  &ldquo;and I will hand you a prize fully worth  twenty dollars without his garments.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But, surely, you are not going to hand some  man or woman over to us?&rdquo; inquired they.
          &ldquo;Ask me no questions, as the Archbishop of  Compostella said to the pretty widow, and I  will be honest with you. The prize I shall  hand you will fetch money in the market, and  we sell not human beings in this country,&rdquo;  urged Juan.
          &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; they exclaimed; &ldquo;and we  will follow you.&rdquo;
          The students followed Juan on to the high-road  leading from the city to Ourense; and  when they had walked for about two hours&rsquo;  time Juan told his companions to get behind  the hedge and await results.
          Soon after, the jingling of bells was heard,  and a muleteer seated cross-legged on a mule,  which preceded five others, was seen approaching.
          As the muleteer had sold all his wares he  was indulging in a sleep, and had it not been  for the dog-flies that teased the mules they  would also have slept.
          Juan let the muleteer pass; but as the last  mule came up he seized it, and, taking off its  trappings, and disencumbering it of its ponderous  albarda, or saddle, he freed the animal on  the roadside, and replaced the trappings and  the saddle on himself.
          His companions were not slow in seizing the  prize and hurrying away with it, while Juan  Rivas continued for some distance along the  road, following in the train of mules.
          As soon as he considered that his companions  would be out of sight, he commenced backing with all his strength, which brought  the mules to a sudden halt and caused their  bells to tinkle.
          The muleteer looked back to see if anything  was wrong, but, perceiving nothing, bestowed a  hearty blow on his mule, and on he went again.
          The student now began to rear and jump  about so that the muleteer pulled up, and,  having dismounted, proceeded to inquire into  the cause of the mule so misbehaving itself;  but his astonishment was great when, instead  of a mule, he saw a human being bearing the  trappings and the saddle.
          &ldquo;What merry freak is this,&rdquo; demanded the  muleteer, addressing the student, &ldquo;that I see  you replacing my mule?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;It is no merry freak, indeed it is not,&rdquo;  replied Juan Rivas, &ldquo;but a sad reality. You  see before you, good master, a poor, miserable  creature, who for his many offences against  Mother Church was transformed into a mule,  and sentenced to remain so for a number of  years. My term of punishment has just expired,  and I am restored to my natural form.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But where is my mule that cost me one  hundred crowns not many years ago?&rdquo; asked  the muleteer.
          &ldquo;You do not understand me, good master,&rdquo;  replied the student. &ldquo;I was the mule, and the  mule was I; now I am I. When you used to  kick your mule, you really kicked me; when  you fed it, you fed me; and now, when you  speak to me, you speak to all that remains of  your mule. Now do you understand?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I am beginning to perceive,&rdquo; said the muleteer,  scratching his head and looking very  sorrowful, &ldquo;that for your sins you were turned  into a mule, and that for mine, I had the misfortune  to purchase you. I always thought  there was something strange about that mule!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;There is no doubt that we all must put up  with the consequences of our evil ways, and, as  you very properly say, you have been punished  by the loss of your mule; but, then, you can  rejoice with me, seeing that the son of the first  Grandee in Spain served you in the humble  capacity of a beast of burden, and now is restored  to rank and wealth.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;And are you a Grandee of Spain?&rdquo;  anxiously inquired the poor man, &ldquo;Why,  then, your excellency will never forgive me for  the many kicks I have bestowed on your excellency&rsquo;s  sides; and I am a ruined man, for  you will have me punished.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Not so, kind friend; not so,&rdquo; replied the  student, in an assuring tone; &ldquo;for how could  you tell that your mule was not a mule?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Then your excellency will not be revenged  on me?&rdquo; continued the muleteer. &ldquo;And if it  will be of any consolation to your excellency,  I promise never to divulge this mystery!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;It will, indeed, be a great comfort to me  to think that no one will know what became of  me for so many years,&rdquo; replied the student.  &ldquo;And now I must bid you good-bye, for I am  in a hurry to again embrace my dear parents if  they be still living.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said the muleteer, with emotion;  &ldquo;and may your excellency never again incur  the displeasure of Mother Church.&rdquo;
          Thus they parted good friends; the muleteer  pondering over what he termed the mysteries  of life, and Juan Rivas full of delight at the  thought of rejoining his companions, and having  a good supper with the proceeds of the mule,  which pleasure was not denied him and his  friends.
          In a fortnight&rsquo;s time there was a cattle fair  in the neighbourhood of Tuy, and as the muleteer  required to replace the mule he had so  mysteriously lost, he attended the fair, and was looking about him for a serviceable mule, when  an acquaintance called out to him to know why  he had parted with the other one.
          &ldquo;I have my private reasons,&rdquo; answered the  muleteer, &ldquo;and I am not here to let you know  them.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; continued his inquisitive friend;  &ldquo;but the proverb says that &lsquo;the mule you  know is better than the mule you don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo;  and if you will take my advice, you will buy your  old mule back again, for there it is&rdquo;&mdash;pointing  to it.
          The muleteer looked in the direction mentioned,  and was horrified at seeing his late mule  again; but, trying to conceal his emotion, he  approached the animal and whispered in its  ear, &ldquo;Those who don&rsquo;t know what sort of a  mule your excellency is may buy you, but I  know the mule you are;&rdquo; and, turning away, he  sorrowfully exclaimed, &ldquo;He has again offended.  Terrible are the judgments of Providence!&rdquo;
