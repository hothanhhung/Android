           Wamba was king of the Goths, who  inhabited the northern part of Lusitania.  He was one of the bravest kings that ever  reigned, and the walls of his palace still stand  as evidence of the skill with which he studied  to improve his capital. But although he was  wise, he was not a good man, and his bravery  in war was not tempered by mercy. Like all  his predecessors, he was cruel to his victims,  and was more feared than loved.
          Wamba had but one daughter, Elvira, whose  mother was a princess of the Moorish family  reigning in Andalusia. She was so beautiful  and so good, that she contributed in no small  degree in rendering her father&rsquo;s reign famous.  Her long hair was of a lovely glossy black; her  eyes, of the same dark hue, had all the softness  of her race, and it was this very tenderness of  look that gave majesty to her appearance.
          In those days there were but very few Christians in Europe. The Crescent of the  false prophet had overcome for a time the  Cross of the true Saviour. To the teachings  of an old man, who in secret worshipped the  true God, Elvira owed the first lessons she got  of Christianity; and once the good seed was  sown, it multiplied.
          Wamba did not know that his daughter was  a Christian; but he knew that she was very  good, and that for her goodness she was very  much beloved by all his subjects.
          Now, it so happened that in the dungeon of  his palace there were many prisoners condemned  to death by starvation, and it perplexed the  king to know how it was that they continued  to live. Every morning he would ask of the  gaoler if the prisoners had died, and the answer  was that they seemed quite well.
          So one day he hid in a nook of the staircase,  hoping to find out who fed his prisoners. He  had not long to wait, for he soon saw Elvira  descending, followed by a young courtier,  Alaric, and carrying something in her apron.
          Elvira, unknown to her father, had been in  the custom of carrying bread to the poor  prisoners, and she was assisted in her work of  mercy by her lover Alaric.
          When she got close to the king, he started  out of his hiding-place, and seizing her by the  arm, she, in her fright, let fall her apron, out  of which fell beautiful roses, into which the  bread had been transformed.
          Great was the surprise of the king, for he  thought she was carrying victuals. Then, in  his rage, he said&mdash;
          &ldquo;Elvira, thou art in league with the evil  one, and thou and thy lover shall die!&rdquo;
          Elvira and Alaric were themselves so astonished  at what had taken place, that they could  not speak, and allowed themselves to be led  away to separate gaols without offering an  explanation.
          Wamba had it proclaimed that next day his  daughter Elvira and her lover Alaric would be  burnt in the public square for having dealings  with the evil one. Many of his oldest courtiers  tried to persuade him that he was too precipitate;  but he was not to be moved, and all that night  Elvira and Alaric were preparing to meet  death.
          At the first ray of light Wamba was up, and  with his soldiers and executioners hurried to  the public square. Elvira and Alaric were led  among a strong body of men, and everything was being prepared for burning the lovers, when  Elvira&rsquo;s old tutor presented himself before  Wamba, and said&mdash;
          &ldquo;Know, O king, that thy daughter fears not  death, for her comfort is on the Cross, and not  on the Crescent. If any one be to blame, I am  he, for I instructed her. Let me, then, be  burned in her stead.&rdquo;
          Wamba gazed fiercely at the old man, and,  raising his massive olive staff surmounted by a  gold crown, exclaimed&mdash;
          &ldquo;Thou shalt also die, but not before thou  hast witnessed her sufferings. Thy God is a  false God, or if He have power to save all of  you, He shall cause this ancient olive staff to  grow and throw out green leaves by to-morrow  morning, or else you shall all die;&rdquo; and saying  this, he stuck his royal staff into the ground.
          Elvira was to be allowed to remain close to  the staff, but no one with her; and, so that she  might not escape, guards were posted all round  the square.
          Kneeling at the side of that emblem of  authority, which for generations had been  wielded by her ancestors, she gave vent to her  prayers and tears, and the latter fell so quickly  that they moistened the ground; and when morning came, Wamba, on arriving, saw his  royal staff growing, a sapling then, but shortly  to grow into a tree, even as the Christian faith  in its sapling stage was to throw out its  spreading branches over the kingdom, till they  all became one people, loving but one God.
          Wamba caused a church to be built near the  spot, which church still exists; and the olive-tree  grows by its side, giving the name of  Olive-tree to the Square.
          Alaric was married to Elvira; and Wamba  having been called to the grave of his forefathers,  these two reigned conjointly, and  appointed the old tutor their counsellor.
