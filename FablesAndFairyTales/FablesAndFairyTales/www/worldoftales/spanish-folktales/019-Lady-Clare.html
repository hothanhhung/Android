          Lady Clare was in her garden overlooking  the sea. It was a summer&rsquo;s day,  and the many coloured butterflies flitted about  under the trees and among the sweet smelling  flowers.
          Lady Clare was combing her golden tresses  with an ivory comb, seated on a crimson velvet  cushion. She looked towards the sea, and she  saw a gallant fleet making for the land.
          He who was in command stepped on shore.  He was a belted knight, but his features could  not be seen as his vizor was down.
          Approaching Lady Clare, he saluted her,  and she thus addressed him&mdash;
          &ldquo;Hast thou, noble knight, seen my husband,  who bid me good-bye many years ago when he  sailed for the Holy Land?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I know not thy husband, fair lady. By what  should I know him?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;He took his white charger with its golden  trappings with him,&rdquo; answered Lady Clare.  &ldquo;On his lance he bore a red pennon; a tress  of my hair served him for a belt, from which  hung his sword. But if thou hast not seen him,  Knight of the Cross, then woe be to me, lonely  widow, for I have three daughters, and they are  all unmarried.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I am a soldier,&rdquo; continued the knight; &ldquo;war  is my employment. But what wouldst thou  give, fair lady, to have thy husband near?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I would give thee more money than thou  couldst count, as well as the roof of my house,  which is made of gold and ivory,&rdquo; answered  Lady Clare.
          &ldquo;I care not for gold nor money; they are of  no use to me, for I am a soldier and engaged  in war, and I never saw thy husband. But  what wouldst thou give, fair lady, to have him  here?&rdquo; inquired the knight.
          &ldquo;I would give thee my jewels, which cannot  be weighed nor measured; I would give thee  my golden loom and my distaff of burnished  silver,&rdquo; said Lady Clare.
          &ldquo;I neither wish for gold nor for silver: with steel is my hand better acquainted, for I am  a warrior, and I never saw thy husband. But  what wouldst thou give to have him near  thee?&rdquo; cried the knight.
          &ldquo;I would let thee choose one of my daughters;  they are as fair as the moon, or as the sun  when rising,&rdquo; urged Lady Clare.
          &ldquo;I do not want thy daughters; they may not  marry me, for I am a soldier and engaged in  warfare, and I never cast eyes on thy husband.  But what wouldst thou give to have thy own  knight here?&rdquo; exclaimed the warrior.
          &ldquo;I cannot give thee more, nor hast thou  more to ask of me,&rdquo; replied Lady Clare.
          &ldquo;Thou hast still more to give, for thou hast  not yet offered thyself, fair lady,&rdquo; said the  knight.
          &ldquo;A belted knight who dare so speak deserves  to be dragged around my garden, tied  to the tails of my horses. Come hither, my  vassals, and punish this rude soldier!&rdquo; exclaimed  Lady Clare.
          &ldquo;Do not call for thy vassals, for they are  mine also,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;and do not be  angry with me, for I have already kissed  thee.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Then thou art surely my brave lord,&rdquo; said Lady Clare; &ldquo;but how wilt thou prove thyself?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;By the golden ring with seven gems which  I divided with thee when I left,&rdquo; answered the  knight. &ldquo;Here is my half; where is thine?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;My daughters,&rdquo; cried the Lady Clare,  &ldquo;bring hither my half of the ring, for your  father is here to claim it! But, oh, my husband,  joy at seeing thee again had nigh made thee  a widower.&rdquo;
