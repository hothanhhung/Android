           There was once a prince who was going  to visit his lady-love, the only daughter  of a neighbouring king; and as he required  the services of an attendant, he sent for his  barber, who was known in the town for his very  good behaviour, as well as for his eccentric  ways.
          &ldquo;Pablo,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;I want you to go  with me to Granada to assist me on my journey.  I will reward you handsomely, and you shall  lack for nothing in the way of food. But you  must don my livery, salute me in the fashion  of Spain, hold my stirrup when I mount, and  do everything that is required of a servant.  Above all, you must not let me oversleep myself,  for otherwise I shall be late in arriving at  Granada.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the barber, &ldquo;I will be as  true to you as the dog was to St. Dominic. When you are sleeping I will be on guard, and  when you are awake I will see that no harm  approaches you; but I beg you not to be  annoyed with me if, in trying to be of service  to you, I do unwillingly cause you any annoyance.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Good Pablo,&rdquo; continued the prince, &ldquo;say  no more, but return to your shop, pack up your  linen, and come here as soon as you can this  evening. If I am in bed when you arrive, you  will know that it is because I must get up to-morrow  morning by five o&rsquo;clock, and see to it  that you let me not sleep beyond that time.&rdquo;
          Pablo hurried home, packed up his few  articles of underclothing, and then proceeded  to the principal wine tavern to tell his friends  of his good fortune. They were all so pleased  to hear of Pablo&rsquo;s good luck that they drank to  his health, and he returned the compliment so  often that at last the wine was beginning to tell  on him, so he bid his friends good-bye and left,  saying to himself, &ldquo;I must wake his highness  at five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; This he kept repeating so  often that he had arrived at the large courtyard  of the palace before he was aware of it.
          The prince&rsquo;s bedroom looked into the courtyard,  and Pablo saw by the dim light that was burning in the room that the prince had retired  to rest.
          Afraid lest the prince should think he had  forgotten all about awaking him, and that he  might therefore be keeping awake, Pablo seized  a long cane, with which he tapped at the window  of the prince, and kept on tapping until the  prince appeared, and opened the window, shouting  out&mdash;
          &ldquo;Who is there? Who wants me?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said Pablo. &ldquo;I have not forgotten  your orders; to-morrow morning I will wake  your highness at five.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Very good, Pablo; but let me sleep awhile,  or else I shall be tired to-morrow.&rdquo;
          As soon as the prince had disappeared Pablo  commenced thinking over all the princes of  whom he had heard, and he had become so  interested in the subject that when he heard  the cock crow, imagining it was daybreak, he  again seized the cane and tapped loudly at the  window.
          The prince again lifted up the sash, and cried  out&mdash;
          &ldquo;Who is it? What do you want? Let me  sleep, or else I shall be tired to-morrow.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; exclaimed the barber, &ldquo;the cock has already crowed, and it must be time to  rise.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; replied the prince, &ldquo;for  it is only half an hour ago since you woke me;  but I am not annoyed with you.&rdquo;
          Pablo was now sorely troubled in his mind  because he thought he might give offence to  the prince, and so he kept revolving in his mind  all that his mother had told him about the anger  of princes, and how much it was to be dreaded.  This thought so perplexed him that he resolved  on putting an end to the life of the cock that  had caused the mistake. He therefore proceeded  to the poultry-yard close by, and seeing  the offender surrounded by the hens, he made  a rush at him, which set all the fowls cackling  as if a fox had broken in.
          The prince, hearing the noise, hurried to the  window, and in a loud voice inquired what the  noise was all about.
          &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Pablo, &ldquo;I was but trying to punish  the disturber of your rest. I have got hold of  him now, and your highness may go to sleep  without further care, as I will not forget to  waken you.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the prince, &ldquo;if you waken  me again before it is time, I will most decidedly punish you.&rdquo; Saying which he again retired to  rest.
          &ldquo;Since the days when cocks crew in the  Holy Land they have always brought sorrow  into this world,&rdquo; inwardly ejaculated Pablo.  &ldquo;His proper place is in the pan, and that is  where he should go if I had my way.&rdquo;
          All at once Pablo commenced to feel very  sleepy, so he walked up and down the yard to  keep awake; but becoming drowsy he sank on  the ground, and was soon so fast asleep that he  dreamt a nigger prince was attacking him,  which made him scream so terribly that it  woke, not only the prince, but also all the dogs  in the neighbourhood.
          The prince again rushed to the window, and  hearing Pablo scream out, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t murder me,  I will give you all!&rdquo; hurried down into the  yard, and seeing how matters stood bestowed  such a hearty kick on Pablo that he jumped  up.
          The frightened barber beholding the prince  near to him, took to his heels, and ran home as  fast as he could.
          When he had got into bed he began regretting  that he had run away from the prince&rsquo;s service,  so he got up again, saying to himself, &ldquo;The prince shall have a sharper spur than I could  ever buckle on;&rdquo; and, proceeding to the principal  door of the palace, he wrote the following words  with chalk, &ldquo;Pablo has gone before your highness  to court the Princess of Granada himself.&rdquo;
          This had the desired effect, for when the  prince arose in the morning and was leaving  the palace alone, he read the words, and they  caused him to be so jealous that he performed  the distance in half the time he would otherwise  have taken.
          Pablo after that used to say that &ldquo;a jealous  man on horseback is first cousin to a flash of  lightning and to a true Spaniard.&rdquo;
