           There was once a very merry, but very  poor hostler in Salamanca. He was so  poor that he had to go about his business in  rags; and one day when he was attending on  the richly caparisoned mule belonging to the  Archbishop of Toledo, he gave vent to his  feelings in words.
          &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my father was always called  a donkey from the day of his marriage; but  would to goodness I were the archbishop&rsquo;s  mule! Look at the rich livery he bears; look  at his stout sides; see how he drinks up his  wine and eats his maize bread! Oh, it would be  a merry life, indeed! My father was, they say,  an ass, so I would be a mule!&rdquo;
          And then he leant against the manger, and  laughed so heartily that the archbishop&rsquo;s mule  stopped eating to look at him.
          &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; said the mule. &ldquo;Remember that my reverend master, being a corpulent man, is  somewhat heavy; but if thou wilt change conditions  with me, thou need but take hold of  both my ears, and, caramba, a mule thou shalt  be, and that in the service of the Archbishop  of Toledo!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;And that will I,&rdquo; answered Pablo the hostler;  &ldquo;for better be a well-fed mule than a starving  hostler.&rdquo; So saying, he seized the mule by the  ears, and, looking at him in the face, he was  immediately transformed; but, to his surprise,  he saw that the quondam mule was changed into  a monk. &ldquo;How now!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Wilt thou  not bring me some more wine and maize bread,  sir monk? Wilt thou not be my hostler?&rdquo;
          But the monk turned away and left the stable,  and Pablo then saw that he had made a mistake.  But he resolved that as soon as he was led out  into the street he would run off to his old mother,  and implore her to intercede on his behalf with  the patron St. James of Compostella.
          When the archbishop had rested, he called  for his mule, which was brought out; and, in the  absence of the hostler, whom they could not  find, one of the attendants was about tightening  the girths, when the mule Pablo, seizing the  opportunity, bolted away as hard as he could down the road in the direction of his mother&rsquo;s  house.
          The archbishop thought his mule had gone  mad, and as the servants followed it, running,  and crying out, &ldquo;Stop the beast&mdash;stop it!&rdquo; the  rabble joined in the chase; but Pablo never  stopped till he got to his mother&rsquo;s house.
          The old woman was at the door, spinning at  her distaff, and as she was very deaf she had  not heard the clamour. Pablo, bending over  her, tried to kiss her hand, to ask her for her  blessing, but his tongue now failed him. So  frightened was she at the approach of the  animal that she hit him over the head with her  distaff, and cried out, &ldquo;Abernuncio!&rdquo;
          By this time the servants had surrounded  him, and were trying to lead him back, but he  would not go. He stood on his hind-legs, and  then lay down on his side, and rolled in the  dust till the scarlet saddle-cloth was spoilt, and  then, suddenly rising, rushed into the cottage,  and tried to sit on his accustomed chair.
          His mother fled the house, and the rabble  entered, and so cudgelled Pablo that he was  fain to return to the inn; and, after being  groomed, he allowed the archbishop to mount  him. However, he had not gone far before he exclaimed, &ldquo;By St. Iago, this mule hath the  pace of a camel!&rdquo; Pablo, not being accustomed  to four legs, did not know how to use them, so  that he would move his right fore and hind  legs together. This caused the archbishop  great inconvenience, for, being a corpulent man,  it made him roll about on the saddle like the  gold ball on the cathedral of Sevilla, when the  west wind loosened it, and the east wind blew  it down.
          Seizing the pommel with both his hands, and  raising himself in his shoe stirrups, he looked as  if he intended to vault over the head of the  mule; and as they were at this moment going  through a village, the inhabitants, who had  come out to see the archbishop, thought he  was about to deliver a sermon. So, surrounding  the mule, they uncovered their heads, and  knelt awaiting the blessing.
          Pablo, forgetting he was a mule, thought the  people were doing homage to him, and being  of a merry disposition, he gave way to such  inward laughter that it brought on a violent fit  of coughing, which the faithful&mdash;not seeing the  face of the archbishop, for they devoutly bent  their heads towards the ground&mdash;took to be the  natural clearing of the throat before speaking. But the archbishop, who was now becoming  seriously frightened, and thinking that the evil  one had entered the body of his mule, exclaimed,  &ldquo;Exorciso te&mdash;abernuncio!&rdquo; Then did  Pablo sit down on his hind-quarters, so that the  archbishop slid off the saddle and rolled on the  ground, and another &ldquo;Abernuncio!&rdquo; in a deeper  tone, brought the devout people to their feet.  Pablo at this moment got up, and by so  doing completely capsized the venerable archbishop,  causing him to turn over on to his head.  Full of dust and anger, the prelate started to  his feet, and carefully examined his mule to see  if he could account for this peculiar behaviour.  Sorely grieved did Pablo feel at having caused  the good archbishop so much annoyance, and,  so as to show his contrition, he went down  on his fore-legs, thinking to kneel, which so  frightened all the people that they instinctively  took shelter behind the archbishop. But he  was as much afraid as the rest, and had it not  been that they held him by his robes, he would  have run away.
          &ldquo;This beats the mule of Merida,&rdquo; cried one,  &ldquo;who ran away with the miller&rsquo;s wife and then  regretted the bargain. See, he is craving for  pardon.&rdquo;
          Pablo the mule rose after kneeling for some  time, and, after the fashion of trained animals  of this breed, he extended his fore and hind-legs,  so as to facilitate the archbishop mounting  him, which he soon did, feeling convinced that  the mule had intended no harm; but Pablo,  regretting his mistake and the loss of time it  had caused, set off at a quick amble, which so  disconcerted his rider that he had to hold on  by the pommel and the crupper; and thus he  was hurried out of the village, and the people  were done out of the blessing.
          The attendants, who were on foot, tried to  keep up with Pablo; but this they could not do,  owing to his long strides; and not until they  were within sight of Toledo did they get up to  their master, who, by this time, was out of  breath and countenance. They, fearing that  the mule might start off again, placed a man  on each side holding the reins, and thus did  they approach the eastern gate of the city, at  which many priests were waiting with the cross  and the sword of the archbishop, in order to  give him a fitting welcome, according to the  rules of the Church. Pablo, seeing the large  silver cross, the emblem of Christianity, slackened  his pace, and when within a few yards of it, in obedience to what his mother had taught  him as a child, dropped down on his knees,  bending his head to the ground; but this he  did so suddenly, that the archbishop fell off the  saddle on to his neck, and, to break his fall,  caught hold of his servants by their ears, nearly  tearing them off, and causing them also to  tumble. Thinking that the evil one had seized  them, they struck out right and left, and nearly  stunned their master with the blows and kicks.  Pablo, hoping to retrieve his fortune, started to  his legs with the archbishop clinging round his  neck, and galloped after the two servants with  his mouth open, so that, should he catch them,  he might bite them. But they, surmising what  he meant, sought refuge among the priests, and  these in their turn made haste to get into a  small chapel close by.
          &ldquo;Our archbishop must have changed mules  with Beelzebub,&rdquo; said a fat priest, &ldquo;for no  earthly animal would thus treat a prince of the  Church!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; continued one of the runaway servants;  &ldquo;and if his neck had been a foot longer I should  have been dangling in mid-air like the coffin of  the false prophet.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I never thought to have run so fast again,&rdquo; ejaculated a very short and stout priest. &ldquo;Faith,  my legs seemed to grow under me, as our  sacristan said after he had been tossed by the  abbot&rsquo;s bull.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But what has become of the archbishop?&rdquo;  said another. &ldquo;We must not leave him in his  sorry plight.&rdquo;
          Saying this, he carefully opened the door of  the chapel, and there they saw their prelate  swooning on the pavement, and Pablo dashing  full tilt among the crowd, trying to wreak his  vengeance on as many as he could possibly get  hold of.
          Having torn the leather breeches of some  half-dozen sightseers, and knocked down and  trampled on some score of men and women,  he rushed out of the city by the same gate, and  never stopped till he arrived at the inn where  he had been hostler. The master of the inn,  thinking that some mishap had befallen the  archbishop, made haste to secure the mule; but  as it was already night, he postponed sending  off one of his servants till next morning.
          Once again at the manger, Pablo had time  to consider over the mistake he had made, and he  would gladly have undergone any punishment,  could he but have regained his former shape.
          While he was thus musing, he saw the monk  approaching, looking very sorrowful indeed.
          &ldquo;Pablo,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how dost thou like being  a mule?&rdquo;
          Now, Pablo was cunning, and, not wishing to  let the monk know what had happened, he  answered&mdash;
          &ldquo;As for liking it, I enjoyed carrying the  archbishop as much as he liked being carried;  but I am not accustomed to such gay trappings  and good living, so that I am afraid of injuring  my health.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;If that be the case,&rdquo; continued the monk,  &ldquo;hold down thy head, and I will relieve thee  of the danger; for, to tell you the truth, I find  out that my wife is still living, and she recognized  me although I was disguised as a monk.  By my faith, I would rather bear my master&rsquo;s  harness to the grave than my wife&rsquo;s tongue  from morning till night! Caramba, I hear her  knocking at the door! Dear Pablo, let us again  exchange conditions.&rdquo;
          And Pablo, when he awoke next morning,  was tightly grasping a beam, thinking he was  the Archbishop of Toledo clinging on to the  mule&rsquo;s neck.
