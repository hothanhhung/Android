           In the North of Portugal there are many  sequestered spots where the enchanted  Moors and the wizards meet when it is full  moon. These places are generally situated  among high rocks on the precipitous sides of  the hills overlooking rivers; and when the wind  is very boisterous their terrible screams and  incantations can be distinctly heard by the  peasantry inhabiting the neighbouring villages.
          On such occasions the father of the family  sets fire to a wisp of straw, and with it makes  the sign of the cross around his house, which  prevents these evil spirits from approaching.  The other members of the family place a few  extra lights before the image of the Virgin; and  the horse-shoe nailed to the door completes the  safety of the house.
          But it will so happen that sometimes an  enchanted Moor, with more cunning than honesty, will get through one of the windows  on the birth of a child, and will brand the  infant with the crescent on his shoulder or  arm, in which case it is well known that the  child, on certain nights, will be changed into  a wolf.
          The enchanted Moors have their castles and  palaces under the ground or beneath the rivers,  and they wander about the earth, seeing but  not seen; for they died unbaptized, and have,  therefore, no rest in the grave.
          They seem to have given preference to the  North of Portugal, where they are held in  great fear by the ignorant peasantry; and it  has been observed that all such of the natives  as have left their homes to study at the universities,  on their return have never been  visited by the enchanted Moors, as it is well  known that they have a great respect for  learning. In fact, one of the kings has said  that until all his subjects were educated they  would never get rid of the enchanted Moors  and wizards.
          In a village called Darque, on the banks of  the Lima, there lived a farmer whose goodness  and ignorance were only equalled by those of  his wife. They were both young and robust, and were sufficiently well off to afford the  luxury of beef once or twice a month. Their  clothes were home-spun, and their hearts were  homely. Beyond their landlord&rsquo;s grounds they  had never stepped; but as he owned nearly  the whole village, it is very evident that they  knew something of this world of ours. They  were both born and married on the estate, as  their parents had been before them, and they  were contented because they had never mixed  with the world.
          One day, when the farmer came home to  have his midday meal of broth and maize  bread, he found his wife in bed with a newborn  baby boy by her side, and he was so  pleased that he spent his hour of rest looking  at the child, so that his meal remained untasted  on the table.
          Kissing his wife and infant, and bidding her  beware of evil eyes, he hurried out of the house  back to his work; and so great was his joy at  being a father that he did not feel hungry.
          He was digging potatoes, and in his excitement  had sent his hoe through some of them,  which, however, he did not notice until he  happened to strike one that was so hard that  the steel of his hoe flashed.
          Thinking it was a pebble, he stooped to  pick it up, but was surprised to see that it was  no longer there.
          However, he went on working, when he  struck another hard potato, and his hoe again  flashed.
          &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the evil one has been sowing  this field with stones, as he did in the days of  good Saint Euphemia, our patroness.&rdquo; Saying  which, he drew out the small crucifix from  under his shirt, and the flinty potato disappeared;  but he noticed that one of its eyes  moved.
          He thought no more of this untoward event,  and went on hoeing until sunset, when, with  the other labourers, he shouldered his hoe and  prepared to go home.
          Never had the distance seemed so great;  but at last he found himself by his wife&rsquo;s bedside.  She told him that while he was absent  an old woman had called, asking for something  to eat, and that as she seemed to have met  with some accident, because there was blood  running down her face, she invited her in,  and told her she might eat what her husband  had left untasted.
          Sitting down at the table, the old woman commenced eating without asking a blessing  on the food; and when she had finished she  approached the bed, and, looking at the infant,  she muttered some words and left the house  hurriedly.
          The husband and wife were very much  afraid that the old woman was a witch; but as  the child went on growing and seemed well  they gradually forgot their visitor.
          The infant was baptized, and was named  John; and when he was old enough he was  sent out to work to help his parents. All the  labourers noticed that John could get through  more work than any man, he was so strong  and active; but he was very silent.
          The remarkable strength of the boy got to  be so spoken about in the village that at last  the wise woman, who was always consulted,  said that there was no doubt but that John was  a wolf-child; and this having come to the ears  of his parents, his body was carefully examined,  and the mark of the crescent was found under  his arm.
          Nothing now remained to be done but to  take John to the great wise woman of Arifana,  and have him disenchanted.
          The day had arrived for the parents to take John with them to Arifana, but when they  looked for him he could nowhere be found.  They searched everywhere&mdash;down the well, in  the river, in the forest&mdash;and made inquiries at  all the villages, but in vain; John had disappeared.
          Weeks went by without any sign of him;  and the winter having set in, the wolves,  through hunger, had become more undaunted  in their attacks on the flocks and herds. The  farmer, afraid of firing at them, lest he might  shoot his son, had laid a trap; and one morning,  to his delight, he saw that a very large  wolf had been caught, which one of his fellow-labourers  was cudgelling. Fearing it might be  the lost wolf-child, he hastened to the spot,  and prevented the wolf receiving more blows;  but it was too late, apparently, to save the  creature&rsquo;s life, for it lay motionless on the  ground as if dead. Hurrying off for the wise  woman of the village, she returned with him;  and, close to the head of the wolf, she gathered  some branches of the common pine-tree, and  lighting them, as some were green and others  dry, a volume of smoke arose like a tower,  reaching to the top of a hill where lived some  notorious enchanted Moors and wizards; so that between the wolf and the said Moors the  distance was covered by a tunnel of smoke and  fire. Then the wise woman intoned the following  words, closing her eyes, and bidding the  rest do so until she should tell them they might  open them:&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Spirit of the mighty wind
              That across the desert howls,
              Help us here to unbind
              All the spells of dreaded ghouls;
              Through the path of smoke and fire
              Rising to the wizards&rsquo; mound,
              Bid the curs&egrave;d mark retire
              From this creature on the ground;
              Bid him take his shape again,
              Free him from the Crescent&rsquo;s power,
              May the holy Cross remain
              On his temple from this hour.&rdquo;
            
          
          She now made the sign of the Cross over the  head of the wolf, and continued:&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;River, winding to the west,
              Stay thy rippling current, stay,
              Jordan&rsquo;s stream thy tide has blest,
              Help us wash this stain away;
              Bear it to the ocean wide,
              Back to Saracenic shore.
              Those who washed in thee have died
              But to live for evermore.&rdquo;
            
          
          Then she sprinkled a few drops over the fire, which caused a larger amount of smoke, and  exclaimed&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Hie thee, spirit, up through smoke,
              Quenched by water and by fire;
              Hie thee far from Christian folk,
              To the wizard&rsquo;s home retire.
              Open wide your eyelids now,
              All the smoke has curled away;
              &rsquo;Neath the peaceful olive bough
              Let us go, and let us pray.&rdquo;
            
          
          Then they all rose, and the wolf was no  longer there. The fire had burned itself out,  and the stream was again running. In slow  procession they went to the olive grotto,  headed by the wise woman; and, after praying,  they returned to the house, where they  found, to their delight, John fast asleep in his  bed; but his arms showed signs of bruises  which had been caused by the cudgelling he  had received when he was caught in the trap.
          There were great rejoicings that day in the  village of Darque; and no one was better  pleased than John at having regained his proper  shape.
          He was never known to join in the inhuman  sport of hunting wolves for pleasure, because,  as he said, although they may not be wolf-children,  they do but obey an instinct which was given them; and to be kind-hearted is to  obey a precept which was given us. And,  owing to the introduction into Portugal of the  Book in which this commandment is to be  found, wolf-children have become scarcer, and  the people wiser.
