          It was proclaimed throughout the kingdom  of Granada that the king had decided on  marrying. The news was first told to the  court barber, then to the night watchmen, and,  in the third place, to the oldest woman in the  city of Granada.
          The barber told all his customers, who again  told all their friends. The night watchmen in  crying the hour proclaimed the news in a loud  voice, so that all the maidens were kept awake  by thinking of the news, and by day they  were being constantly reminded by all the old  due&ntilde;as that the king had resolved to marry.
          After the news had become somewhat stale,  the question was asked, &ldquo;Who is the king  going to marry?&rdquo; To which the barber made  reply, that probably &ldquo;he would marry a  woman.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; exclaimed his hearers. &ldquo;Why,  what else could he marry?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Not all women are worthy the name,&rdquo;  answered the barber. &ldquo;Some more resemble  the unbaptized, of whom I say, abernuncio.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But what mean you, good friend?&rdquo; demanded  his customers. &ldquo;Is not the king to  find a woman for wife in our land of Spain?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;He would,&rdquo; replied the barber, &ldquo;with  greater ease find the reverse; but to find a  woman worthy to be his wife I shall have  great trouble.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;What, you?&rdquo; exclaimed all of them. &ldquo;What  have you got to do with providing the king  with a wife?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I am under royal licence, remember,&rdquo; said  he of the razor; &ldquo;for I am the only man in  the kingdom permitted to rub the royal features.  I am the possessor of the magic mirror  also, into which if any woman not being  thoroughly good shall look, the blemishes on  her character will appear as so many spots on  its surface.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Is this one of the conditions?&rdquo; asked all.
          &ldquo;This is the sole condition,&rdquo; replied the  barber, placing his thumbs in the armholes of  his waistcoat and looking very wise.
          &ldquo;But is there no limit as to age?&rdquo; they  again inquired.
          &ldquo;Any woman from eighteen years upwards  is eligible,&rdquo; said the possessor of the mirror.
          &ldquo;Then you will have every woman in  Granada claiming the right to be queen!&rdquo; all  exclaimed.
          &ldquo;But, first of all, they will have to justify  their claim, for I will not take any woman at her  word. No; she will have to gaze into the mirror  with me by her side,&rdquo; continued the barber.
          The sole condition imposed on those who  desired to become Queen of Granada was made  known, and was much ridiculed, as may naturally  be supposed; but, strange to say, no woman  applied to the barber to have a look into the  mirror.
          Days and weeks went by, but the king was  no nearer getting a wife. Some generous ladies  would try and prevail on their lady friends to  make the trial, but none seemed ambitious of  the honour.
          The king, be it known, was a very handsome  man, and was beloved by all his subjects for his  many virtues; therefore it was surprising that  none of the lovely ladies who attended court  should try to become his wife.
          Many excuses and explanations were given.  Some were already engaged to be married,  others professed themselves too proud to enter  the barber&rsquo;s shop, while others assured their  friends that they had resolved on remaining  single.
          The latter seem to have been cleverer in  their excuses, for it was soon observable that no  man in Granada would marry, assigning as a  reason for this that until the king was suited  they would not think of marrying; though the  real cause may have been due to the objection  of the ladies to look into the mirror.
          The fathers of families were much annoyed  at the apparent want of female ambition in their  daughters, while the mothers were strangely  silent on the matter.
          Every morning the king would ask the barber  if any young lady had ventured on looking  into the mirror; but the answer was always  the same&mdash;that many watched his shop to see  if others went there, but none had ventured in.
          &ldquo;Ah, Granada, Granada!&rdquo; exclaimed the  king; &ldquo;hast thou no daughter to offer thy  king? In this Alhambra did my predecessors  enjoy the company of their wives; and am I to  be denied this natural comfort?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Royal master,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;in those  days the magic mirror was unknown and not  so much required. Men then only studied  the arts, but now is science added to their  studies.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;You mean, then,&rdquo; asked the king, &ldquo;that an  increase in knowledge has done no good?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I mean more than that,&rdquo; continued the  barber; &ldquo;I mean that people are worse than  they used to be.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;God is great!&rsquo; is what these walls proclaim;  to know is to be wise,&rdquo; urged the king.
          &ldquo;Not always, sir,&rdquo; said the barber; &ldquo;for the  majority of men and women in the present know  too much and are not too wise, although some  deem them wise for being cunning. There is  as great a distance between wisdom and cunning  as there is between the heavens and the  earth.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Barber,&rdquo; shouted the king, &ldquo;thou shalt get  me a wife bright as the day, pure as dew, and  good as gold&mdash;one who shall not be afraid to  look into thy magic mirror!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the barber, &ldquo;the only magic  about my mirror is that which the evil consciences  of the ladies of Granada conjure up.  The simple shepherdess on the mountain side would brave the magic power of any mirror,  strong in the consciousness of innocence; but  would you marry such a lowly one?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Such a woman is worthy to be a queen, for  she is a pearl without price,&rdquo; answered the  king. &ldquo;Go, bid her come here; and, in the presence  of my assembled court, let the gentle  shepherdess look into the mirror, after thou  hast told her of the danger of so doing.&rdquo;
          The barber was not long in bringing the  shepherdess to court with him; and it having  been proclaimed throughout the city that the  trial was going to be made, the principal hall  was soon filled with all the grand ladies and  knights of the king&rsquo;s household.
          When the shepherdess entered the royal  presence she felt very shy at being surrounded  by so much grandeur; but she knew enough  about her own sex to understand that they  inwardly considered her not quite so ugly as  they audibly expressed her to be.
          The king was very much pleased with her  appearance, and received her very kindly,  telling her that if she desired to be his wife  she would have to gaze into the magic mirror,  and if she had done aught which was not consistent  with her maidenly character, the mirror would show as many stains on its surface as  there might be blemishes on her heart.
          &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;we are all sinners  in the sight of God, they say; but I am a poor  shepherdess, and surrounded by my flock. I  have known what it is to be loved, for, when  the sheep have perceived danger, they have  come to me for protection. The wild flowers  have been my only ornament, the sky almost  my only roof, and God my truest and best  friend. Therefore, I fear not to look into that  magic mirror; for although I have no ambition  to become queen, yet am I not lacking in that  pride which is born of the desire to be good.&rdquo;
          Saying which, she walked up to the mirror  and gazed into it, blushing slightly, perhaps at  the sight of her own beauty, which before she  had only seen portrayed in the still brook.
          The court ladies surrounded her; and when  they saw that the magic mirror showed no  stains on its surface, they snatched it from her,  and exclaimed&mdash;
          &ldquo;There is no magic in it&mdash;a cheat has been  put on us!&rdquo;
          But the king said&mdash;
          &ldquo;No, ladies; you have only yourselves to  thank. Had you been as innocent as this shepherdess, who is going to be my queen,  you would not have dreaded looking into the  mirror.&rdquo;
          After the marriage the barber was heard to  say, that as the magic mirror had now lost its  virtue, who could tell but what this charm  might be restored to Granada?
