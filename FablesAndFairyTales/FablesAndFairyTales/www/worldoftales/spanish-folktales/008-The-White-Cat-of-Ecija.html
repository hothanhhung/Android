          From the gates of the palace, situated on  a gentle eminence in the vicinity of Ecija,  down to the banks of the Genil, the ground was  covered with olive-trees; and the wild aloes  formed a natural and strong fence around the  property of the White Cat of Ecija, whose  origin, dating back to the days of Saracenic  rule, was unknown to the liberated Spaniard.
          There was a great mystery attaching to the  palace and its occupants; and although the  servants of the White Cat were to all appearances  human beings, still, as they were deaf  and dumb, and would not, or could not, understand  signs, the neighbours had not been able  to discover the secret or mystery.
          The palace was a noble building, after the  style of the alcazar at Toledo, but not so large;  and the garden at the rear was laid out with  many small lakes, round which, at short distances, stood beautifully sculptured statues of  young men and women, who seemed to be  looking sorrowfully into the water. Only the  brain and hand of an exceptionally gifted artist  could have so approached perfection as to  make the statues look as if alive. At night  strings of small lamps were hung round the  lakes, and from the interior of the palace proceeded  strains of sweet, but very sad music.
          Curiosity had long ceased to trouble the  neighbours as to the mysterious White Cat  and her household, and, with the exception of  crossing themselves when they passed by the  grounds, they had given up the affair as incomprehensible.
          Those, however, who had seen the White  Cat, said that she was a beautiful creature; her  coat was like velvet, and her eyes were like  pearls.
          One day a knight in armour, and mounted  on a coal-black charger, arrived at the principal  hostelry in Ecija, and on his shield he bore  for his coat of arms a white cat rampant, and,  underneath, the device, &ldquo;Invincible.&rdquo;
          Having partaken of some slight repast, he  put spurs to his horse and galloped in the  direction of the palace of the White Cat; but as he was not seen to return through the town,  the people supposed that he had left by some  other road.
          The White Cat was seen next day walking  about in the grounds, but she seemed more  sorrowful than usual.
          In another month&rsquo;s time there came another  knight fully equipped, and mounted on a grey  charger. On his shield he also displayed a  white cat, with the device, &ldquo;I win or die.&rdquo; He  also galloped off to the palace, or alcazar, and  was not seen to return; but next day the White  Cat was still more sorrowful.
          In another month a fresh knight appeared.  He was a handsome youth, and his bearing  was so manly that a crowd collected. He was  fully equipped, but on his shield he displayed  a simple red cross. He partook of some food,  and then cantered out of the town with his  lance at rest. He was seen to approach the  palace, and as soon as he thrust open the gate  with his lance, a terrific roar was heard, and  then a sheet of fire flashed from the palace  door, and they saw a horrid dragon, whose  long tail, as it lashed the air, produced such a  wind that it seemed as if a gale had suddenly  sprung up.
          But the gallant knight was not daunted, and  eagerly scanned the dragon as if to see where  he might strike him.
          Suddenly it was seen that the dragon held  the White Cat under its talons, so that the  Knight of the Cross in charging the dragon had  to take care not to strike her. Spurring his  horse on, he never pulled up till he had transfixed  the dragon with his lance, and, jumping  off the saddle, he drew his sword and cut off  the monster&rsquo;s head.
          No sooner had he done this than he was  surrounded by ten enormous serpents, who  tried to coil round him; but as fast as they  attacked him, he strangled them.
          Then the serpents turned into twenty black  vultures with fiery beaks, and they tried to  pick out his eyes; but with his trusty blade  he kept them off, and one by one he killed  them all, and then found himself surrounded  by forty dark-haired and dark-eyed lovely  maidens, who would have thrown their arms  around him, but that he, fearing their intentions  were evil, kept them off; when, looking on the  ground, he saw the White Cat panting, and  heard her bid him &ldquo;strike.&rdquo;
          He waited no longer, but struck at them and cut off their heads, and then saw that the  ground was covered with burning coal, which  would have scorched the White Cat and killed  her, had not the gallant knight raised her in  his arms. He then placed her on his shield,  and as soon as she touched the cross she was  seen to change into a beautiful maiden, and all  the statues round the lakes left their positions  and approached her.
          As soon as she could recover herself sufficiently  to speak, she addressed the knight as  follows&mdash;
          &ldquo;Gallant sir, I am Mizpah, only daughter  of Mudi Ben Raschid, who was governor  of this province for many years under the  Moorish king, Almandazar the Superb. My  mother was daughter of Alcharan, governor  of Mazagan, and she was a good wife and kind  mother. But my father discovering that she  had forsaken the faith of her fathers, and had  embraced the religion of the Cross, so worried  her to return to her childhood&rsquo;s faith that she  died broken-hearted. Then he married again,  and his second wife, my stepmother, was a  very wicked woman. She knew that I was  a Christian at heart, and that my lover was  also a Christian; so one day, when my father was holding a banquet, she said to him, &lsquo;Mudi  Ben Raschid, the crescent of the Holy Prophet  is waning in thy family&mdash;thy daughter is a  renegade!&rsquo;
          &ldquo;Then he was very much annoyed, and exclaimed  that he would his palace and his riches  were made over to the enemy of mankind and  I turned into a cat, than that so great a stain  should fall on his family. No sooner had he  finished speaking than he fell dead and his  wicked wife also, and I was turned into a cat;  my lover, Haroun, and all my young friends  were turned into stone, and my servants were  stricken deaf and dumb. Many a brave knight  has been here to try and deliver me; but they  all failed, because they only trusted in themselves,  and were therefore defeated. But thou,  gallant knight, didst trust more on the Cross  than on thyself, and thou hast freed me. I  am, therefore, the prize of thy good sword;  deal with me as thou wilt.&rdquo;
          The Knight of the Cross assured her that  he came from Compostella, where it was considered  a duty to rescue maidens in distress,  and that the highest reward coveted was that  of doing their duty. He had in various parts  of the world been fortunate enough in freeing others, and he had still more work before him.  He trusted that the lovely Mizpah might long  be spared to Haroun, and, saluting her, he  galloped off.
          Then was the wedding held, at which all the  people from Ecija attended; and the bridegroom,  rising, wished prosperity to the good  knight, St. James of Compostella, who had been  the means of bringing about so much happiness.
