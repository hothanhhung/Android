           Down the slopes of the neighbouring  mountains were heard the stirring sounds  of the bagpipes and drums, and at short intervals  a halfpenny rocket would explode in mid-air,  streaking the blue sky with a wreath of  smoke.
          Nearer and nearer came the sounds, and the  villagers stood at their cottage doors waiting  for the musicians to pass. Next to the firing  of rockets nothing can be more heart-stirring  than the martial sound of the pipes and drums.  The big drum was, on this occasion, played  most masterly by the auctioneer and clown  of the parish church, called Jos&eacute; Carcunda, or  Joseph the Hunchback.
          Jos&eacute; Carcunda was dressed in his gala  uniform&mdash;cocked hat, scarlet coat with rich  gold lace embroidery, white trousers, and red morocco slippers. He was a clever man, and  could take many parts in the church plays acted  in public for the benefit of the faithful. Sometimes  he was Herod, at others, St. Joseph;  again he would appear as Judas, and then as  Solomon; but in this latter capacity he had  given some offence to the vicar by appearing  on the stage under the influence of drink.
          Of all the weaknesses to which human flesh  is heir, none is more despised in Portugal than  drunkenness. Wine is emblematical of that  stream which flowed from the Crucified on  Calvary, and the abuse of such a precious gift  is not easily overlooked.
          Within the narrow bounds of their primitive  way of thinking are cast some of the finest  traits in the character of the Portuguese  peasantry, although, in many instances, to this  very same source must be attributed some of  their peculiar ideas as to fate. They are  fatalists to a very great extent.
          In Roman Catholic countries, the Sabbath  is remembered by attending mass in the  morning, and by amusements in the afternoon.  No public-house, with its glittering lights within,  with its bright and cosy fire, and with its  grand display of mirrors and pictures, invites the peasant to step inside and gossip about his  neighbours, while sipping the genial juice of  the grape, or the fire-water that gives to the  eye a supernatural brightness, and to the  tongue a rush of foolish language. There is  no law against such houses, but there is a  popular prejudice.
          Jos&eacute; Carcunda was heard to say, after he  had been guilty of drinking to excess when  attired as Solomon, that his faithful dog Ponto  refused to accompany him home on that  occasion; &ldquo;And as the creature stared at me,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;I could see shame and sorrow  mingling in his eyes.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;There comes the Carcunda!&rdquo; exclaimed the  village belle, Belmira. &ldquo;He is half hidden by  the drum; but to-morrow we shall see him at  early mass, when the good St. Anthony is to  be raised to the rank of major.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her lover, Manoel; &ldquo;and it will  be a grand sight, for the priest showed me the Gazette in which is the king&rsquo;s warrant. St.  Anthony&rsquo;s regiment is to arrive to-morrow, and  after the image has donned the uniform the  soldiers will present arms, the bombs will  explode, rockets will be fired, and the band  will play.&rdquo;
          As the musicians entered the village,  heralding the grand entertainment to be held  next day, the people cheered them heartily,  and followed them to the church, situated on  the top of a small hill, around which bonfires  were in course of preparation for the night.
          A cart laden with water-melons, another with  a pipe of green wine, and a few stalls where  sweetstuff was exposed for sale, formed the  principal feature of the fair.
          The door of the church was thrown open,  and the main altar was lit up with many lights.  The chapels on each side were festooned with  garlands of flowers; but that dedicated to the  miraculous St. Anthony, junior major in the  10th regiment of infantry, was the grandest of  all, with its magnificent silk draperies, and the  altar decorated with flowers.
          Jos&eacute; Carcunda was a proud man that day.  He had presided over all the arrangements,  and they had given great satisfaction. Belmira  had set the other girls the example of showing  him their gratitude by kissing him. He was  so overwhelmed by their caresses that he tried  to get clear of them, lest his wife might be  jealous; but it was of no use trying to free  himself, for they made him sit on a stone bench, and, handing him a guitar, requested him to  extemporize some verses:&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Fair ladies mine, I love the wine,
              But music I love better;
              Still stronger far than song divine,
              I love the ladies better.
            
             &ldquo;I love the fields with flowerets bright,
              The birds with carol merry;
              I love the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
            
          
          &ldquo;No, I cannot sing just now; I am too  happy,&rdquo; exclaimed the hunchback. &ldquo;I feel like  the rich miser of Santillana, when he recollected  that he would be buried at the expense of the  parish. So as my helpmate Joanna come not  here, I care not how long the troops delay in  arriving. Ah, Joanna is too good for me, as  the runaway criminal said of the gallows; and  the older she gets the more I recognize it!  Yes, Joanna is too good for me and for this  world; but we don&rsquo;t make ourselves&mdash;no, we  don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
          Here Jos&eacute; Carcunda shook his head very  wisely, and looked at his slippered feet with  some pardonable pride.
          &ldquo;Look you here,&rdquo; said one of his fair companions,  &ldquo;you are very stupid to-day; you will not sing, nor will you dance. Will you, then,  tell us the tale about the sorrowful mule, and  what befell her, or about the merry friar who  turned highwayman to enrich the Church, or  about the palaces of the enchanted Moors?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I will tell you something that happened to  me when I was a young man,&rdquo; answered the  hunchback.
          &ldquo;Know, then,&rdquo; continued Jos&eacute; Carcunda,  &ldquo;that in my younger days I was an almocreve  (muleteer), and owned six of the finest mules  in the province of the Beira. I used to attend  the weekly fair held at the university city,  Coimbra, where I found a good market for my  earthenware with which I loaded the mules.
          &ldquo;Fortune had favoured me, and I had saved  some gold crowns; and on Sundays, when I  had shaved and put on clean linen, I was the  pride of the village.
          &ldquo;One summer&rsquo;s day, as I was leading my  six mules, fully laden with pots and pans, to  Coimbra, a student, who was on the roadside,  saluted me and said&mdash;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Good Jos&eacute;, I have a great favour to ask  of you, and one that I know you will not deny  me.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Your excellency,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;has but to order, and I will obey, so long as you place not my  eternal happiness in jeopardy.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;The saints forbid,&rsquo; answered the student,  &lsquo;that I should ask you to do anything but what  a Christian man should do! No, friend Jos&eacute;,  my errand is indeed a strange and sad one;  but I feel that I must be as true to (with your  leave) a mule as my profession requires me to  be to a human being.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed I, &lsquo;are you under some  spell, some wicked enchantment, that you make  promises to (with your excellency&rsquo;s leave) a  mule, which is the accursed animal since the  days of Bethlehem?&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;No, good friend,&rsquo; continued the sorrowful  student; &lsquo;I am under no spell, but under a vow;  for I have promised to convey some sad news  to (with your leave) that mouse-coloured mule  of yours, and I feel that I must break it gently  to her.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you see before you a man  who knows not the difference between the Credo and the Paternoster when they are  written; and though I have heard say that if  you want to see thieves you must get inside  a prison and look at the passers-by, still am I  not inclined to think that if you desire to see knaves you must look in at the windows of the  university. My mule (with your excellency&rsquo;s  permission) is but a mule, and has no knowledge  of sorrow or of language; therefore, of  what avail to speak to her?&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;You are much mistaken,&rsquo; answered the  student, who now had tears in his eyes, &lsquo;for it  is well known that even the irrational animals  have feelings, and they have been heard to  speak. Good friend, grant me my request, for,  as I said before, I am under a vow.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Have your way, dear sir,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but if  the animal bites you, blame not me. She is  but a stubborn thing at the best of times.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;The six mules were tied one to the other,  and each had a big load of pots and pans.  They were standing in the middle of the road  with their gay trappings and bells about them;  and as I looked at the mouse-coloured one, I  wondered what the student could have to say  to her and how he would say it; but, as you  know, these men who frequent the university  are so learned that they can repeat the Credo backwards way, which is the great secret in the  black art.
          &ldquo;The student, having obtained my permission  to speak to the mouse-coloured mule, approached her gradually, exclaiming at intervals,  &lsquo;Poor creature, how she will take it to  heart! But I am under a vow. I must tell  her&mdash;I must; but it is so painful!&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Senhor,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;you remind me of  the Alcaide of Montijo, who hesitated to  approach his mother-in-law until she was  gloved. What you have to say, that say, and  let me go my way.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Unthoughtful man!&rsquo; cried the student;  &lsquo;little you wot of the sad news I have to break  to that poor creature! To you a mule is but  a four-legged creature, the cathedral bell but  a thing of brass, and the university but the  abode of the black art. You are absolutely  ignorant, sir,&rsquo; continued the student, &lsquo;for which  you have much to be thankful; for if you were  a student you would not sell earthenware pans,  and would therefore lose the profit which you  now make; and were you a student, you would  at this moment be all of a tremble, for you  would then know that we are at this present  moment standing over a frightful abyss that  will soon yawn to receive its prey.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;I was now terribly frightened lest the  student, in his calculations, should have made  the mistake of a minute, so I rushed to the foremost mule so as to get her to lead the way  out of the danger; but the student prevented  me, saying&mdash;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Not that way, for you will fall into the pit.  Let me first of all whisper my news into the  mouse-coloured mule&rsquo;s ear, and all may yet be  well.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Hurry, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;or else we shall all  be lost.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;It is a very good thing to be in a hurry  when you know what to do,&rsquo; answered the  student; &lsquo;but we must be cautious. Therefore,  step lightly that way until you reach yonder  lofty tree and get up it; but, before doing so,  fill your pockets with stones.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;I can assure you that I was not long in  carrying out the student&rsquo;s instructions, and  never have I trod so lightly on the ground as  I did that day. The student, as soon as he  saw me half-way up the tree, shouted out,  &lsquo;Here it comes! Oh, this is awful&mdash;just as I  told her all about it! Oh dear, oh dear!&rsquo;
          &ldquo;I now noticed that the student was taking  long jumps in the direction of the tree up  which I had climbed, and at every jump he  would call out, &lsquo;Shut your eyes, or you will  become blind!&rsquo;
          &ldquo;Then I heard a most dreadful noise, as if  the end of the world had come; but I could  still hear the student crying out, &lsquo;Shut your  eyes, good friend, or you will be blinded!&rsquo;
          &ldquo;I have never been so terrified either before  or since that day, and I was also in considerable  pain, as the stones which I had placed in  the pockets of my pants had, with climbing,  almost sunk into me.
          &ldquo;After having kept my eyes closed for some  time, I ventured on opening them, and then I  saw a sight which told me I was a ruined man.  My mules were rolling about in the dust, and  all my pots and pans were wrecked. The  mouse-coloured mule, moreover, seemed to be  demented; she rolled and writhed so that it  seemed as if she were in awful distress, and  there was no doubt but that she had dragged  the others down with her.
          &ldquo;Suddenly I heard the voice of the student,  and, looking down, I saw that he was seated on  a branch just below me. &lsquo;Ah, poor creature,&rsquo;  said he, &lsquo;how terribly she feels the bereavement!  Let us descend,&rsquo; continued he, &lsquo;for the  danger is now over, and we must, as Christian  men, render aid to the poor dumb animals.&rsquo;  Saying which he slid down the tree, and I after him as well as I could; and as soon as we again  got on the road, he bid me try to pacify the  mouse-coloured mule, while he would do his  utmost to get the leader to get up.
          &ldquo;I saw that all my earthenware was broken,  and I gave myself up to grief. &lsquo;Unlucky man  that I am!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;What harm can I  have done to have deserved so great a punishment,  and what, sir student, did you say to yon  mule to make her act so?&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Alas, friend Jos&eacute;,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we of the  educated class understand resignation, but to  such as you, as well as to the irrational creation,  is this virtue denied. You bemoan the loss of  your earthenware; and yonder dumb creature,  with perhaps a glimmering of humanity about  her, but certainly with more reason than you,  deplores the loss of a good and beloved parent,  who, on his death-bed, implored me to inform  his daughter when I should next see her that  he had died thinking of her, and that he  bequeathed to her all he had to give, namely,  the right of pasturage over all the lands in Spain  and Portugal, and as much more as she could  snatch from her neighbour when in the stable.  Good-bye, friend Jos&eacute;; my vow is accomplished,  and I leave you in peace with your mules.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;And with the broken earthenware,&rsquo; said I,  &lsquo;and with my fortunes blasted, and with my  legs bleeding; and all because I met you!&rsquo;
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Say not so, friend Jos&eacute;, for had it not  been for me you would most assuredly have  been swallowed up by the underground abyss.  No, say not so, nor yet complain of your mouse-coloured  mule, for to lament the death of a  father is but natural.&rsquo;
          &ldquo;The student walked quietly away, and I  then set to making the mules get up, which,  after much trouble, I succeeded in doing; but  noticing that the mouse-coloured mule kept  her head on one side as if in pain, I examined  her, and on looking into her ear I discovered  the end of a cigarette which that vile student  had purposely dropped into it. I now knew  that I had been deceived; but the cheat had  already disappeared, so, like a wise man, I  trudged home, sold my animals to pay my  debts, and, having nothing better to do, I  married Joanna and became, as you know, the  church clown and auctioneer.&rdquo;
