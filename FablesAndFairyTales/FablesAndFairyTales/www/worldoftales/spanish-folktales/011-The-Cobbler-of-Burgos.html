           Not far from the Garden of the Widows,  in Burgos, lived a cobbler who was so  poor that he had not even smiled for many  years. Every day he saw the widow ladies  pass his small shop on the way to and from the  garden; but in their bereavement it would not  have been considered correct for them to have  bestowed a glance on him, and they required  all the money they could scrape together, after  making ample provision for their comfort&mdash;which,  as ladies, they did not neglect&mdash;to pay  for Masses for the repose of the souls of their  husbands, according to the doctrines of the  faith which was pinned on to them in childhood.
          The priests, however, would sometimes bestow  their blessing on Sancho the cobbler; but  beyond words he got nothing from the comforters  of the widows and of the orphans.
          Some of the great families would have their boots soled by him; but being very great and  rich people, they demanded long credit, so that  he was heard to say that a rich man&rsquo;s money  was almost as scarce as virtue.
          Now, one night, when he was about to close  his shop, a lovely young widow lady pushed  her way by him into the shop, and sitting on  the only chair in the room, she bid him close  the door immediately, as she had something to  say to him in confidence.
          Being a true Spaniard, he showed no surprise,  but obeyed orders, and stood before the young  widow lady, who, after looking at him carefully  for a minute, implored him to go upstairs and  see that the windows were secure and the  shutters barred and bolted.
          This done, he again stood before her, when  she showed signs of fear, and requested him to  ensure against the doors being burst open by  piling what furniture he had against them and  against the shutters; and then, assuring herself  that she was safe, she exclaimed&mdash;
          &ldquo;Ah, friend Sancho, it is good to beware of  evil tongues. I come to you because I know  you to be honest and silent. To-night you  must sleep on the roof; get out through the  skylight, and I will rest here.&rdquo;
          To refuse a lady&rsquo;s commands, however  singular they may be, is not in the nature of a  Spaniard, so Sancho got out through the skylight,  when the young widow began screaming,  &ldquo;Let me out, kind people&mdash;let me out!&rdquo;
          The cobbler was now very much afraid of  the consequences, especially as the night watchmen  were banging against the street door,  which they soon forced, knocking all the  furniture which had been placed against it  into the middle of the room.
          When inside, they discovered the lovely  young widow, who exclaimed&mdash;
          &ldquo;Good men, I am Guiomar, of Torrezon,  widow of the noble Pedro de Torrezon, and  because my late husband was owing Sancho for  soling a pair of boots, I came here to pay the  debt; but Sancho would have detained me  against my will. He is concealed on the roof  of the house, and if you leave me here he will  murder me.&rdquo;
          Then she naturally fainted and screamed for  so long a time that the street was soon full of  people who, hearing what had happened, cried  out against Sancho.
          The watchmen having secured him, he was  led before the alcaide, and, being a poor man, he was sent to prison until such time as Donna  Guiomar should feel disposed to pardon him.
          At the end of a year Donna Guiomar  obtained his liberty, but on the condition that  he should forthwith proceed to Rome and do  penance, which was to count for the benefit of  her deceased husband.
          This act of piety on her part was very much  approved of by the priests, who required of  Sancho that during the whole of his pilgrimage  there he should not shave, nor have his hair  nor his nails cut. He was, furthermore, to  wear a suit of horse-hair cloth next to his skin,  and was to subsist solely on onions, garlic, maize  bread, and pure water.
          But liberty is so sweet that Sancho did not  mind his hard fare, and he went on his way to  Rome repeating penitential prayers, while his  hair and beard grew until his head and face  were nearly hidden.
          Arrived at Rome, the people wondered much  to see such a strange-looking being; but when  he opened his mouth to inquire his way to  St. Peter&rsquo;s, so strong was the smell of onions  and garlic that the people, accustomed as they  were to these vegetables, could not stand against  it, and as Sancho spoke in a foreign tongue they could not have understood him very  easily.
          At last he met a priest who was kind enough  to listen to him, and he said he would be  allowed audience of the Pope next morning  with other pilgrims, but that meantime he had  better confess what his fault had been.
          Sancho recounted all about the lovely young  widow, and the priest very properly admonished  him for having dared to frighten a lady whose  anxiety respecting her deceased husband was  quite enough of sorrow without having it added  to by being forcibly detained by a cobbler.
          &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said the worthy priest, &ldquo;that  you were not handed over to the inquisitorial  brothers, for they would have burned you  before you were allowed to import the odour  of all the fields of Spanish onions and garlic  into the Eternal City. It is a sign of the bad  times that are approaching when errant cobblers  are allowed to vitiate the precincts of St. Peter&rsquo;s  with their pestilential breath. To-morrow you  will be regaled with a view&mdash;mind, only a view&mdash;of  his holiness&rsquo;s toe, and then you must  depart this city.&rdquo;
          Sancho recognized the truth of what the  good priest said, and, having refreshed himself with some more onions and a glass of water,  he lay down to sleep behind one of the large  stone pillars and slept until next morning, when  the large bell of the cathedral awoke him. He  then hurried in to the presence of the Pope,  nor had he much difficulty in so doing, for the  other pilgrims were glad to get out of his way.  Bowing low before the golden chair, he  exclaimed&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;One weary soul, though cobbler he by trade,
              Comes here to seek a pardon for his sin;
              Most holy father, ere the daylight fade,
              Oh, let me in!
            
             &ldquo;From sunny Spain, where runs the Arlanzon,
              To thee, oh, father, come I now to crave
              That thou wilt raise Don Pedro Torrezon
              From restless grave,
            
             &ldquo;And to his widow him restore again.
              This done, dismiss me to my home in peace,
              To be thy servant as a priest in Spain,
              And faith increase.&rdquo;
            
          
          To which the Pope replied&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;We smelt thee from afar, oh, son of Spain;
              We know thy errand, and we grant thy prayer.
              Where onions shed their perfume, son, remain,
              Thy presence spare.
            
            &ldquo;Yes, spare us all thy Spanish odours strong;
              Return unto thy country, Sancho&mdash;go;
              And as a blessing on thy journey long,
              Stoop, kiss our toe.&rdquo;
            
          
          And when Sancho got back to Burgos he  was met by Don Pedro de Torrezon, who, half  in anger and half in sorrow, exclaimed&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Good Sancho, I would spend eternity
              Surrounded by the pains of purgat&rsquo;ry,
              Than be restored unto this mortal life,
              Where purgat&rsquo;ry is but the name for wife.&rdquo;
