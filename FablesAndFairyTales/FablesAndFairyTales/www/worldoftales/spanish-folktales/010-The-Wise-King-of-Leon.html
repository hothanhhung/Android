          There was a rich nobleman who had  three sons; and the king, being very fond  of him, appointed the eldest son his page, the  second his butler, and the youngest his barber.
          The barber fell in love with the king&rsquo;s only  daughter, who was equally fond of him; and  when this came to the ears of the king, he  decided on putting a stop to it; so he called for  the princess, and said&mdash;
          &ldquo;I know that you are in love with my barber,  and if you insist on marrying him I will have  you killed.&rdquo;
          The princess, on hearing her father say this,  became very sorrowful, and asked him to allow  her one day for consideration, to which the  king acceded.
          She then went to her room, and getting  together some of her finest dresses, she made them up into a bundle, and left the palace by  a secret door.
          For seven days and nights did the princess  walk through the forest, subsisting on wild  fruit and the water from the rivulets. For  seven days and nights did her father seek for  her, and, not finding her, he sent for the barber,  and told him that he must immediately go in  search of the princess, and if he did not bring  her back within a year he should die.
          At the end of the seventh day the princess  was so tired that she could not continue her  journey; and being afraid of the wolves, she  managed to climb on to the first branch of a  large oak-tree; and when there, discovering that  the trunk was hollow, she let herself slip down  into the hollow, and there rested.
          She had not been long in her hiding-place  when her lover, the barber, approached, sighing,  and saying to himself&mdash;
          &ldquo;Woe is me, for I shall never find the princess!  There are so many lovely damsels in  Castille, and yet I must fall in love with the  king&rsquo;s only daughter.&rdquo;
          The princess, hearing him speak, said in a  disguised voice&mdash;
          &ldquo;Woe is the king&rsquo;s daughter! There are so many gallants in Spain, and yet she must  fall in love with her father&rsquo;s barber!&rdquo;
          The barber was much surprised to hear this  apt rejoinder; but he could not find out from  whence the voice came. He looked about  everywhere, and at last, feeling sleepy, he lay  down under the oak-tree where the princess  was hidden.
          In a very short time the barber was fast  asleep; and the princess, hearing him breathe  heavily, got out of her hiding-place, mounted  the barber&rsquo;s horse, which the king had given  him, and rode away with the barber&rsquo;s bundle of  clothes, leaving her own in its place.
          When she had ridden at full speed for some  hours she dismounted, and opening the barber&rsquo;s  bundle, she then disrobed herself and put on  male attire.
          Next day she had arrived in the kingdom of  Leon, and she rode up to the king&rsquo;s palace and  offered her services to the king as barber.
          The king, being much struck by the stately  bearing of the stranger, willingly accepted the  proffered services.
          When the real barber awoke and found his  horse and clothes gone he was much alarmed;  but seeing a bundle close to him he opened it, and was delighted to find his lover&rsquo;s dresses  in it.
          Being a beardless youth, and very handsome,  he bethought him of putting on the princess&rsquo;s  finest dress; and as his hair was very long and  curly, according to the fashion of the day, he  made a very pretty woman.
          Foot-sore and weary, he at last arrived at the  palace of the King of Leon, and was admitted  to the king&rsquo;s presence as the daughter of the  neighbouring King of Castille.
          The King of Leon was so charmed with the  beauty of the new arrival that he could not  sleep, and so he sent for the barber, to whom  he confided his love.
          The real princess was much astonished to  hear that her lover was in the palace, for she  guessed it was he in female attire; but she  kept quiet until her lover was asleep in bed,  and then she stole into his room, put back his  clothes, and took her own away.
          Next morning when the real barber awoke  and found his magnificent dresses gone and his  male attire restored to him he was indeed surprised;  but there was no help for it&mdash;he must  again become a man and a barber.
          The princess put on her own clothes, and hid in a cupboard of the room. When she saw  her lover leave the room, and heard him go  down the staircase, she closed the door behind  him and finished her toilet.
          The king got up earlier than usual, for he was  so anxious to see the new arrival; but before  doing so he sent for the barber to shave him.
          They looked everywhere for him, but without  success; and at last, in despair, they went to  the bedroom of the new arrival, and, knocking  at the door, intimated the king&rsquo;s command that  she should present herself.
          The princess was ready; and, slipping past  the courtiers, presented herself before the king.
          &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; inquired the king.
          &ldquo;I am the daughter of the King of Castille,  as I informed your mercy yesterday,&rdquo; answered  the princess.
          &ldquo;But where, then, is my barber?&rdquo; rejoined  the king.
          &ldquo;What does one king&rsquo;s daughter know  about another king&rsquo;s barber?&rdquo; said the princess.
          At this moment the real barber presented  himself, and humbly begged the king&rsquo;s pardon  for having deceived him.
          &ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo; roared the king. &ldquo;Are  you a barber or a thief?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I am the youngest son of a marquess,&rdquo;  answered the youth, &ldquo;a barber by trade, and  affianced to the daughter of the King of  Castille.&rdquo;
          Then the princess stepped forward and  explained everything to the king, who was so  interested with what he heard, that the princess  and the barber had to tell the tale over and  over again to him. Then he said&mdash;
          &ldquo;I have been shaved by the King of Castille&rsquo;s  daughter, and I have courted his barber.  I will not be again deceived. They shall now  be man and wife for ever.&rdquo;
          This was the wise King of Leon.
