           There was once a king who was so wicked  that he would not allow any widows to  live in his kingdom, because he was certain that  they had caused the death of their husbands;  nor would he admit of any fat man or woman,  as he was afraid that they would eat up everything  in the kingdom.
          He was also very proud and arrogant, and  if any man happened to be taller than himself,  he would give him the choice of being lowered  to a proper height by either having his head  or his legs cut off.
          His subjects were so afraid of him and of  his laws, that the married women would not  let their husbands go out of their sight, lest  any harm should happen to them, and if they  turned at all pale, or had broken sleep, or had  lost their appetites, they would nurse them  night and day. So afraid were they of becoming widows that they always agreed with their  husbands on all points, lest by disagreeing they  should bring about an attack of indigestion,  or something worse that might produce death.
          And when their children commenced to  grow rapidly, their fears were doubled lest  they should become taller than the king; for  if they fed them on pudding, which does not  promote growth, they incurred the danger of  their becoming fat; and if they fed them on  meat, so as to make them lean, they would  probably grow tall.
          It very soon became evident that there were  more hunchbacks in that country than in any  other; for as soon as the children were  approaching the forbidden height, their parents  would suspend heavy weights from their  shoulders, so that their backs became rounded  and eventually humped.
          The young men, when they were at an age  to marry, found it very difficult to get any  woman to have them, because they were afraid  of becoming widows, and also because so many  of the men were humpbacked.
          But, notwithstanding the king&rsquo;s wickedness,  it was admitted by the married men that their  condition had considerably improved.
          There was a wide road made round the  cities and towns, on which all who were inclined  to be stout, both men and women, would run  until they were out of breath, and jump over  hurdles; and there were so many of these  people that the revenues of the Church commenced  to suffer, owing to the decreased  demand for &ldquo;bulls,&rdquo; as they willingly imposed  long fasts on themselves.
          Now, in the chief city of this country there  was a very wise man, well versed in the law  and in concocting drugs, for he was the public  executioner and the chemist of the place. To  him, therefore, went a deputation of the people  to lay their grievances before him; and after  the spokesman had finished what he had to  say, the executioner looked very wise, and,  after considering awhile, he said&mdash;
          &ldquo;Our king&rsquo;s predecessor was held to be just  and generous because he allowed every man to  retain a fifth of his produce for the maintenance  of his family, and the tax he imposed on this  fifth part was always readily paid.&rdquo; Here he  touched the edge of his sharp axe and smiled;  and the deputation exclaimed&mdash;
          &ldquo;Quite right; so it was.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Now, the present king,&rdquo; continued the wise man, again feeling the edge of his axe, &ldquo;has  magnanimously increased your loyal tribute to  him by one part in a hundred of the produce  of the land, and yet you are not satisfied!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s generosity we all feel,&rdquo; said the  deputation; &ldquo;but, if we may be allowed to  express an opinion to you, sir, we would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Certainly you may,&rdquo; interrupted the man of  drugs, running his hand quickly over the axe&mdash;&ldquo;certainly  you may; why should you not?&rdquo;
          By this time the chief spokesman had got  behind the others, and it was very evident  that the members of the deputation were  becoming aware that the logic of the executioner  was too sharp for them.
          Seeing that they were all silent, the executioner  went on to say that the king had, in his  opinion, been extremely considerate; for he  had, by the law against widows, contributed to  the happiness and long life of the husbands;  and, by enacting that no man should exceed a  certain height or stoutness, they had economized  in many ways, for they ate less, and their  clothes would cost them less. In fact, he saw  no reason for dissatisfaction; but as they had  come to him as a deputation, he felt it to be his  duty to place their supposed grievances before the king, and he, the executioner, felt certain  that the king would reply to them in a suitable  manner. And having said this he raised the  axe to the light to see that there was no notch  on the edge, which caused the deputation to  tremble most violently, and to assure the executioner  that they were perfectly satisfied, and  desired to withdraw.
          The executioner, however, would not allow  them to retire&mdash;for the grievances of a people  should not be withheld from the king&rsquo;s ear;  but the members of the deputation became so  frightened that they made their escape through  the windows as fast as they could. And when  the king heard all about it he remarked that  &ldquo;Folly had entered with dignity by the door,  and Wisdom had unceremoniously escaped  through the window.&rdquo;
