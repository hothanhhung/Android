          When Spain was fortunately in possession  of the enlightened Moors a spirit  of chivalry pervaded all classes, which degenerated  after the departure of Boabdil from  Granada.
          The Moorish blood permeated the veins of  the majority of the Spaniards; but a religious  despotism completely subdued the minds of  all, and Spain, under the yoke of the Jesuits,  became a land more famed for its autos da f&eacute; than for its progress in the fine arts and  sciences, which, to a very great extent, were  ignored.
          Some there were, however, in whom the  blood of the Moors was stronger than the faith  in their new religion, which, however good in  the abstract, was most pernicious in its consequences.
          It has been the abuse, not the use, of the Christian religion which has made of the  Spaniard what his conqueror, the Moor, would  have most loathed.
          In the province of Galliza is situated the  village of Porrinho, lying in a beautiful valley,  and surrounded by meadow-land and fields of  maize.
          Here lived the merry grazier, Sebastian de  las Cabras, famous for his encounters with  wolves, but looked down upon by his neighbours  because it was known that he was  descended from the Moors.
          In all the village there was not a man could  handle the quarter-staff like Sebastian, and so  correct was his aim that, with a sling, he would  at a hundred yards hurl a stone and hit a bull  between the eyes, and so kill it.
          With his knife he was equally skilful, for he  could use the blade to pick up the oil from his  plate instead of licking it up with a spoon, or,  in a quarrel, make it find a sheath in the leg or  arm of a rival.
          Now, this Sebastian, with all his ingenuity  and merriment, had, like most men, a grievance;  but, unlike most men&rsquo;s grievances, his was  against the good St. Vincent, whose patched-up  body (some of it, having decayed, being filled up with wax) is entombed in different cathedrals  throughout Spain and Portugal, each  cathedral professing to possess the veritable  body of the veritable saint.
          But in this plurality of St. Vincent there is  nothing singular; for did they not fill three  large ships with the eye-teeth of good St.  James of Compostella when they were written  for from Rome, and did not the Pope declare  them all genuine teeth?
          Spain, in her religious fanaticism, is no more  like other countries than Sebastian de las  Cabras was like other men.
          St. Vincent, be it known, is worshipped in  the Peninsula as the guardian saint against that  horrible scourge, small-pox.
          In Galliza it is declared all diseases and  misfortunes in life were produced in order that  there should be patron saints; and this is just  as true as the saying in Leon, that wheat was  produced so that there might be stomachs.
          Sebastian de las Cabras cared neither for the  saints nor for the sayings; he feared neither  the law nor the evil one; but he quailed before  his wife, D. Barbara, whose beauty, like that of  the demolished alcazar at Ecija, was a thing of  the past.
          D. Barbara was, however, a woman who  made herself respected; and of all the saints  in the calendar there was none for whom she  had so great a veneration as St. Vincent, who  had saved her when suffering from small-pox.
          Not the three wives who got up from  their graves in Merida and appeared to the  husband to whom they had all been married,  produced a more startling effect on that  widower than D. Barbara on her husband  Sebastian, when she would visit him as he  was tending his herds on the mountain sides,  for no woman ever had such a tongue. Even  the Archbishop of Compostella, in pity to the  clergy of his diocese, had ordained that D. Barbara  needed no confession. He absolved her  from all sin for the love and veneration she had  for St. Vincent, but blamed the good saint for  the mercy he had shown D. Barbara.
          Sebastian de las Cabras had been to the  tombs of St. Vincent in Compostella, in Salamanca,  Cadiz, Malaga, and Seville, to induce  the good saint to undo his good work; but the  bodies were inexorable, and Barbara continued  to plague him with her tongue, and to mark  him with her nails.
          Seeing that he could get no relief for his home troubles from St. Vincent, Sebastian  recollected the faith of his fathers, and bethought  of applying for advice to an old Moor  who lived in the neighbouring village.
          To this wise man he therefore went; and,  after explaining matters, he declared that he  bore no ill-will to his wife, but rather to the  saint, for that it was owing to him that D. Barbara  was spared.
          &ldquo;It is a difficult matter,&rdquo; said the Moor,  &ldquo;and one that will require great consideration  and prudence before attempting to master it.  You Christians make saints to serve you, and  because your interests are not all alike you  blame the saints for not doing what is obviously  impossible. Now, I know that he whom you  call St. Vincent loved the tongue of a woman  no better than the scimitar of the Saracen, and  for this reason did he probably prefer to spare  the life of D. Barbara than be importuned by  her in his place of rest.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;What, then, would you advise me to do, for  with D. Barbara I can no longer live?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;There are St. Nicholas, St. Tiburtius,  St. Bartholomew, and others who equally fear  the noise of a woman&rsquo;s tongue; but little St.  Francis died stone-deaf, and being naturally of an envious disposition, nothing would please  him better than to revenge himself on his  colleagues by foisting D. Barbara on to them.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But if little St. Francis be deaf, how shall  I make him hear my complaint?&rdquo; demanded  Sebastian.
          &ldquo;Thou art no true Catholic if thou knowest  not the weakness of the saints in general, but  of their keepers here on earth in particular.  Thou mayest shout thyself deaf, dance, and  jump, but they may not hear thee; but if thou  showest them the bright yellow gold thou wilt  be heard and understood, even if thou hadst  not a voice, and wert as dumb as thou wouldst  wish D. Barbara to be,&rdquo; answered the Moor.
          &ldquo;I will away, then, to the market and sell  some of my finest beasts, and the money which  I receive for them will I gladly bestow on little  St. Francis,&rdquo; said Sebastian.
          The oxen were sold, and Sebastian hurried  away with the money to the shrine of little  St. Francis; and after devoutly praying, he  proceeded to count out the gold pieces one by  one; and great was his joy when he noticed  the saint commence to move, open his eyes,  stretch out his hands, and declare that Sebastian&rsquo;s  petition should be granted.
          That very night when Sebastian and his  wife were in bed, and the latter was delivering  a lengthy lecture on the coarseness and want of  breeding in snoring when a lady was speaking,  little St. Francis appeared at the bedside with  a mirror in his hand.
          &ldquo;Barbara,&rdquo; said the saint, &ldquo;thy virtues are  known to us, and as a reward we have decreed  that thou shalt be restored to youth and beauty,  which thou shalt thyself behold when looking  into this mirror; but beware no angry or vain  words pass thy lips, for then will thy lack of  modesty be punished by hideous old age and  infirmity, therefore, beware!&rdquo; And saying this,  he left the now happy pair&mdash;Barbara admiring  herself in the mirror by the light of a cruse,  and Sebastian enjoying that unbroken sleep  which he had not known for years.
          The mirror never passed out of D. Barbara&rsquo;s  possession, and was never known to leave her  hand until her frame, gradually tired out by  want of rest, succumbed to the fascination of  little St. Francis&rsquo;s gift and the wisdom of the  friendly Moor.
