           There was once a little boy called Sigli,  who, I am sorry to say, took great  pleasure in catching and killing little birds.  His father was a notorious robber, so it was  not surprising that Sigli gave way to acts of  cruelty. His mother died when he was little  more than a year old, and he did not know  any other relation. In the north of Portugal,  bands of robbers used to frequent the roads,  and some of them lived in strong castles, and  had a large retinue of followers. In time of  war these robber-chiefs would side with the  king&rsquo;s party, because after the war was over  they received large grants of land for the  assistance they had rendered the sovereign.  Sometimes when the neighbouring kings of  Spain invaded Portugal, these robbers proved  of great advantage in repelling the invaders;  but in following up their victories they would despoil all the churches in the enemy&rsquo;s country  of the gold and silver idols, which the priests  had caused to be made in order to get the  ignorant peasantry to make offerings of money,  corn, and oil, in exchange for which the priests,  in the name of the idols, offered all those who  gave, pardon of their sins.
          Now, Sigli&rsquo;s father had on many occasions  robbed gold and silver idols, and had murdered  a few brethren of the Holy Inquisition, who,  in their turn, were well known for the wicked  deeds they had committed, such as burning  Christian men and women who did not, and  could not, profess the popish faith. But in  course of time the Jesuits, for so they were  called, made common cause against these  robbers, and either put them to death, or obliged  them to leave off robbing churches and take  to cheating the peasantry.
          Sigli, as I said before, was a very cruel boy,  and he was the terror of all the birds and  beasts. He would lay traps for them, and  when he had caught them he would take  pleasure in tormenting them, which clearly  proved that he was not a Christian, nor  possessed of any refinement. But he took  more pleasure in catching Robin-redbreasts than in anything else, and for this purpose he  used bird-lime. He had caught and killed so  many that at last King Robin of Birdland issued  invitations to all his feathered subjects and to  the beasts of the field, asking them to a meeting  at which they might discuss the best means  of putting Sigli to death, or punishing him in  some other way, for the cruelty of which he  was guilty towards them.
          Among the many who accepted the invitation  was an old fox, the first of the Reynards,  and when it came to his turn to speak, he said  that as Sigli was so fond of catching redbreasts  with bird-lime, he (Mr. Reynard) would propose  catching Sigli in the same manner; and  when caught they might discuss how they  should punish him, either by pecking and  biting him, or by getting the wolves to eat  him. In order to carry out this idea, he  suggested that the monkeys should be asked  to prepare the bird-lime, which they might use  with safety by oiling their hands, and then  gradually make a man of bird-lime close to the  robber chief&rsquo;s castle. Sigli would probably  take it for some poor man, and hit it, and then  he would not be able to get away.
          This idea was accepted by all in general, and by Mrs. Queen Bee in particular, who owed  Sigli and his father a grudge for destroying her  hive; and the monkeys cheerfully set to work,  while King Robin watched the putting together  of the figure, and was very useful in giving it  most of the artistic merit it possessed when  finished. The making took one whole night, and  next morning, almost opposite the castle, stood  the bird-lime figure about the size of a man.
          Sigli, seeing it from his dressing-room window,  and taking it for a beggar, was so enraged  that he ran out without his shoes and stockings,  and, without waiting to look at the man, he  struck at him with his right hand so that it  stuck firmly to the figure.
          &ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;or I will kick you!&rdquo;  And as the figure did not let go he kicked it,  so that his foot was glued. &ldquo;Let go my foot,&rdquo;  he cried out, &ldquo;or I will kick you with the  other;&rdquo; and, doing so, both his legs were glued  to it. Then he knocked up against the figure,  and the more he did so the more firmly he  was glued.
          Then his father, hearing his cries, rushed  out, and said&mdash;
          &ldquo;Oh, you bad man! I will squeeze you to  death for hurting my dear Sigli!&rdquo;
          No sooner said than done, and the robber  chief was glued on to the bird-lime figure.
          The screams of the two attracted the attention  of the servants, who, seeing their robber  master, as they thought, murdering his little  boy, ran away and never came back again.
          King Robin was now master of the situation,  and he directed ten thousand bees under  General Bumble, and another ten thousand  wasps under Colonel Hornet, to fall on the  robber and cruel Sigli and sting them to death.  But this was hardly necessary, as the wriggling  of their bodies so fixed them to the figure that  they died of suffocation.
          Then King Robin ordered the wolves to  dig a large grave, into which the monkeys  rolled Sigli, his father, and the bird-lime figure;  and after covering it up, they all took charge  of the castle, and lived there for many years  undisturbed, acknowledging King Robin as  their king; and if the Jesuits did not turn them  out, I am certain they are still there.
