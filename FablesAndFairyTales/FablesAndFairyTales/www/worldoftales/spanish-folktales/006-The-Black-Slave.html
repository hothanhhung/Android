          There was once a princess who had a  black man slave.
          &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; said the black slave one day, &ldquo;I  know that you love the good Count of Yanno  very much; but you cannot marry him, for he is  already married. Why not, then, marry me?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;I love, as you say, the Count of Yanno,  and I know that he is married; but my father  is a very powerful king, and he can render his  marriage void. As for you,&rdquo; continued the  princess, &ldquo;I would rather marry the lowest  born man of my own race than a nigger!&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Remember, princess, for how many years  I have been your true slave&mdash;how I used to  look after you when you were a child. Did I  not once save you from the fangs of a wolf?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;You need not tell me,&rdquo; answered the  princess, &ldquo;that you love me as slaves love  their superiors; but should you ever speak again about marrying me, I will tell my royal  father.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;If you mention the love that slaves generally  have to their owners, I will not contradict you;  but I think that sometimes masters are more  unworthy the love of their slaves than the  slaves are entitled to the love of their masters,&rdquo;  said the slave.
          &ldquo;You belong to us by purchase or by inheritance,&rdquo;  continued the princess, &ldquo;and we do  not belong to you. The white man gains the  love of the lady of his choice by deeds of arms;  he bears on his lance the banner embroidered  by his lady-love, and, as a true knight, he makes  verses in her honour.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Chivalry, as you understand it, is to me  a fable; for if one of your pale-faced knights  risk his life, it is on behalf of his family pride,  although he may mention his lady-love&rsquo;s name  with his dying breath; but if a slave lay down  his life for his master or mistress, it is only  reckoned a part of his duty,&rdquo; urged the slave.
          &ldquo;I command you not to speak to me again  like this,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;or I will have you  severely punished.&rdquo;
          The poor slave was very sorrowful when he  heard the princess, whom he loved so dearly, threaten to have him punished. &ldquo;Death is the  leveller of all ranks and of all races,&rdquo; said he;  &ldquo;the dust of the dead white man and of the  nigger are alike; in death, the king is no more  than the beggar. I will run away from this  palace and seek refuge in the northern provinces,  where, if the climate be colder, they say the  hearts of the people are warmer.&rdquo;
          That very night did Mobarec&mdash;for that was  the name of the slave&mdash;leave the palace of his  lady-love, the beautiful banks of the Guadalquivir,  and his favourite orange-groves. During  the daytime he hid in the caves on the  mountain-sides, and as soon as night set in he  would continue his journey.
          When he had been travelling like this for  some weeks, and as he was making his way  through a dark forest, he saw a brilliant light  in the distance; and as he was very hungry,  he hoped that it might be from some house  where he might get food and rest. As he  walked on he discovered that the light was  not from a house, but that it was caused by  a large bonfire, around which some men and  women were seated.
          Fearing that he might be in the neighbourhood  of robbers, he took the precaution of approaching by hiding behind the trees; and  when he got near enough to the group to see  them plainly, he observed that close to the fire  there was a very old woman standing with her  arms over the fire, and holding a child which  screamed as if it were being burned.
          Mobarec thought that the child was going  to be roasted, and did not know that what he  saw was simply the act of disenchantment,  which was being carried out by the wise  woman of the village on a child born with the  evil eye.
          Approaching still nearer, he heard the crone  mutter some words, which Mobarec imagined  to be used in order to stifle the piteous cries of  the child.
          The crone suddenly commenced shrieking  and jumping over the fire, while the men and  women who surrounded her beat the air with  big sticks, which is done when the evil one  is supposed to be leaving the body of the  child.
          Just at this moment Mobarec happened to  show himself from behind the tree, when he  was immediately observed by the wise woman,  who directed all eyes to him; and their horror  can be easily imagined when it is said that Mobarec was the first nigger who had ever  visited the northern parts of Spain.
          Mobarec, on perceiving that he was seen,  thought he would smile, in order to show them  that he was a friend; but this made him look  all the more terrible by the glare of the fire,  and, thinking that he was the evil one that had  just left the body of the child, they first of all  crossed themselves and then ran towards  Mobarec with their bludgeons, who, without  more ado, took to his feet and was soon lost  in the darkness of the forest.
          Having baffled his pursuers, Mobarec sat down  to rest and to think over what he had seen.
          &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;that these  people were trying to make a king by burning  a white child until he became black, for I could  see that they were not going to eat it. I have  been told that in some parts they will only  have black kings, and I am certainly in one of  these parts.&rdquo;
          Musing over this idea for a long time, he at  last fell asleep, and dreamt that he had arrived  at a large city, where the people had crowded  to meet him, and that he was placed on a  magnificent throne, crowned king, and had  married his dear princess.
          Then he thought he was in a magnificent  bed-chamber, and that the sheets of his bed  were fringed with fine lace; but purposing to  raise the richly embroidered clothes a little  higher, as he felt cold, he placed his hands on  some stinging nettles, which made him wake  and look around.
          The day was already commencing; the timid  rabbit was lurking about the dew-spangled  leaves; the linnets were hopping about from  branch to branch, and the wheels of some  market carts were heard creaking in the distance.
          Mobarec got up, and looking at himself in  the waters of a passing stream, he was surprised  to see that he had a golden crown on  his head. It was, however, but the morning  sun shining through the thick foliage above  him.
          &ldquo;I was a slave last night,&rdquo; exclaimed Mobarec;  &ldquo;this morning I am a king.&rdquo;
          He noticed the direction from which the  noise of the cart wheels proceeded, and  hurrying thither, he soon came within sight  of some people who were carrying their wares  to market.
          Mobarec gradually approached them, and, seeing him advance, they dropped their baskets,  and would have run away if fear had not  deprived them of the power to do so.
          &ldquo;Be not afraid,&rdquo; said the nigger, &ldquo;for I am  your king. Hitherto you have had to work for  the rich, but now the rich shall work for you.  There shall be no poverty in my kingdom, no  hunger, and no sorrow. Bad husbands shall  take the place of the asses at the mills, and  quarrelsome wives shall have a borough to  themselves. Go,&rdquo; continued he, addressing the  crowd, &ldquo;and tell the inhabitants of the city  that I am approaching.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo; shouted his hearers.  &ldquo;Long live the good king who will free us  from our quarrelsome wives!&rdquo; exclaimed the  men; &ldquo;And who will send our cruel husbands  to replace the asses at the mills!&rdquo; shrieked the  women. &ldquo;Long live the king who will banish  poverty!&rdquo; cried all together.
          Having given vent to their enthusiasm, they  hurried off to the city, and the good news soon  spread that a new king was coming, and that  they would all be rich.
          Then they prepared a richly caparisoned  white mule, with tinkling bells round its neck  and a cloth of gold on its back, for the black king&rsquo;s use, and they went out in a body to meet  him.
          Having approached Mobarec, they prostrated  themselves before him, and were at first very  much afraid; but hearing him address the mule  in a grand speech, they rose and listened.
          &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mobarec to the mule, &ldquo;I feel  highly flattered by this ovation, and I confer  on you here the post of principal minister,  which you richly deserve for the sagacity you  have shown in preserving silence when all want  to make themselves heard. You will see that  the poor are provided for, and that they provide  for the wants of their king and his chosen  ministers, of which you are the chief. People,&rdquo;  exclaimed Mobarec, &ldquo;behold your king and  his minister! And from this day forward let  every man and woman in my kingdom strive  to be as sure-footed, patient, and silent as this  my minister.&rdquo;
          It must be confessed that the people were  somewhat surprised at the turn events had  taken; but as, recently, they had had a most  unjust chief minister, they contented themselves  with the knowledge that his successor  could not introduce any cruel measures.
          With similar ideas occupying them, they retraced their way to the city, preceded by  their black king and his chief minister.
          Arrived at the palace, Mobarec entered and  took his seat on the throne, his chief minister  standing close to the lowest step. He then  addressed the audience as follows&mdash;
          &ldquo;I make it known that the rich persons of this  kingdom shall, if so required, give up their wealth  to the poor, who will then become rich; but, as  I would not that those who have hitherto been  poor should forget their duty to their more  unfortunate fellow-creatures, I declare that they  shall have to contribute not only to the maintenance  of the king, his ministers, and the  state, but also to the requirements of those at  whose expense they have themselves acquired  riches. I also command that all disputes shall  be submitted to the superior wisdom of my  chief minister, without whose verbal consent  it shall be treasonable to have recourse to  blows; and I further require of my liege subjects  that they engage in no war with neighbouring  states without taking their wives to  battle.&rdquo;
          This speech was very much applauded, and  the white mule, being unaccustomed to the  surroundings, commenced braying so loudly that Mobarec got up from his throne and  said&mdash;
          &ldquo;Listen to the voice of my minister; he bids  you all be silent while you pay him homage.&rdquo;
          Then one by one they passed before the  mule, bowing to him; and when this ceremony  was finished Mobarec informed them that all  real kings were of his colour, but that he had  resolved on marrying the daughter of Xisto,  false king of Andalusia; and, therefore, he commanded  twenty of his subjects to proceed to  that kingdom, and bring back with them the  fair Princess Zeyn, which was the name of the  princess he loved.
          &ldquo;If they ask you what I am like, say that  you have never seen one like me, and that my  wisdom is only approached by that of my chief  minister,&rdquo; said Mobarec.
          At the end of a month the twenty men  returned with the lovely princess, who, until  her marriage-day, was lodged in another  palace.
          Great preparations were made for the occasion,  excepting in one borough of the city,  which was deserted, for it had been assigned to  all quarrelsome wives.
          The princess was naturally very anxious to see her future husband, but etiquette forbade  her doing so. Often had she thought of her  runaway slave and lover. Absence had made  her fonder of him, and little by little he had  grown less black to her imagination.
          At last the wedding-day arrived. Mobarec,  attended by all his court, proceeded to the  princess&rsquo;s palace, dressed in magnificent apparel,  his strong black arms bare, but with  splendid gold bracelets round them, and a  belt of the same metal round his waist. His  coat of mail was interwoven with threads of  gold; but his heart required no gold to set it  off, it was purity itself.
          As soon as the princess saw him she recognized  her former slave, and, hurrying to meet  him, threw her arms round his neck, exclaiming&mdash;
          &ldquo;I am not worthy to marry so good a man;  but if you will have me, I am yours.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; exclaimed Mobarec, &ldquo;if I before  was thy slave, I am none the less so now; for  since the first man was created, beautiful  woman has made all men captives. If I have  aught to ask of thee now, &rsquo;tis that thy dominion  over thy new subjects shall be as pleasant to  them as it will be delightful to me.&rdquo;
          From so wise a king and good a queen the  people derived great benefit; disputes never  went beyond the ears of the chief minister,  and, in the words of the immortal barber and  poet of the city, &ldquo;the kingdom flourished  under the guidance of a mule; which proves  that there are qualities in the irrational beings  which even wisest ministers would do well to  imitate.&rdquo;
