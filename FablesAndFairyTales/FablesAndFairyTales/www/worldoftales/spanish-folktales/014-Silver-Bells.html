           It was in a lovely pine-wood that little Mirabella  wandered lonely and hungry. The  sand under her feet was very cool, and the  tufted pine-trees sheltered her from the fierce  rays of the sun.
          Through an avenue of tall but bare pine-trees  she could see the big sea, which she  looked upon for the first time. Faint and  hungry as she was, she could not help wishing  to be nearer the waves; but she recollected  what her father had once told her, that little  children should be careful not to go too near  the sea when they are alone.
          Her father, however, was dead. He was  King of the Silver Isles, and for his goodness  had been loved by all his subjects. Mirabella  was his only child; and her mother having  married again, she wanted to get rid of Mirabella,  so that her little boy Gliglu might inherit the crown. So she ordered one of her servants  to lead Mirabella into the pine-wood far away  and leave her there, hoping the wolves would  find her and eat her.
          When Mirabella was born, her aunt, who  was a fairy, gave her a silver bell, which she  tied around the child&rsquo;s neck with a fairy chain  that could not be broken. In vain did her  mother try to take it from her; no scissors  could cut through it, and her strength could  not break it, so that wherever Mirabella went  the silver bell tinkled merrily.
          Now, it so happened that on the second night  on which she was out the silver bell tinkled  so loudly, that a wolf who happened to be  near, hearing it, approached her and said&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;
              To obey you, Mirabella, I am here.&rdquo;
            
          
          At first the little girl was very much afraid,  because she had heard of the cruelty of  wolves; but when he repeated the words, she  said&mdash;
          &ldquo;Dear Mr. Wolf, if you would be so kind  as to bring me my mamma, I would be so obliged.&rdquo;
          Off ran the wolf without saying another  word, and Mirabella commenced jumping for joy, causing her silver bell to tinkle more than  ever. A fox, hearing it, came up to her and  said&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;
              To obey you, Mirabella, I am here.&rdquo;
            
          
          Then she said, &ldquo;Oh, dear Mr. Fox, I am so hungry! I wish you would bring me something  to eat.&rdquo;
          Off went the fox, and in a short time he  returned with a roast fowl, bread, a plate,  knife, and fork, all nicely placed in a basket.  On the top of these things was a clean white  cloth, which she spread on the ground, and on  which she placed her dinner. She was indeed  thankful to the fox for his kindness, and patted  his head, which made him wag his thick brush.  She enjoyed her dinner very much; but she  was very thirsty. She thought she would try  tinkling her bell, and no sooner had she done  so than she heard the tinkling of another bell  in the distance, coming nearer and nearer  to her. She stood on tiptoe, and she saw a  stream of water flowing towards her, on which  floated a pretty canoe. When it got up to her  it stopped, and inside the canoe was a silver  mug; but on the bows of the canoe was hanging  a silver bell just like her own.          
          
             &ldquo;Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;
              When thy mother comes, step in here.&rdquo;
            
          
          So sang the canoe; but she could not understand  why she should get into the canoe if her  mother came, because she loved her mother,  and thought her mother loved her. Anyhow  she took hold of the mug, and, filling it with  water, drank it up. Water, which is always  the most refreshing of all drinks, was what the  tired little girl most needed, and as her father  had brought her up very carefully and properly,  she had never tasted anything stronger; but  her thirst made her enjoy the water more than  she ever had.
          Suddenly she heard some one screaming for  help, and the screams came nearer and nearer  to her. She turned round and saw the wolf  bearing her mother on his back, and however  much she tried to get off she could not, because  the wolf threatened to bite her. Springing up  to Mirabella&rsquo;s side, the wolf said&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;
              To obey you, Mirabella, I am here.&rdquo;
            
          
          The wicked mother now jumped off his back,  and commenced scolding Mirabella for having  sent for her. She said that as soon as she  got back to the palace she would make a law that all the wolves should be killed, and that if  Mirabella ever dared return she should be  smothered. The poor little girl felt very  miserable, and was afraid that her mother  might kill her, so she stepped into the canoe,  and said&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Bear me where my father dwells,
              Tinkle, tinkle, silver bells.&rdquo;
            
          
          The stream continued to flow, and as the  canoe moved on she saw her mother turned  into a cork-tree, and she bid good-bye to the  wolf and the fox. On sped the boat, and it  soon neared the big sea; but Mirabella felt no  fear, for the stream struck out across the ocean,  and the waves did not come near her. For  three days and nights the silver bells tinkled  and the canoe sped on; and when the morning  of the fourth day came, she saw that they were  approaching a beautiful island, on which were  growing many palm-trees, which are called  sacred palms. The grass was far greener than  any she had ever seen, for the sun was more  brilliant, but not so fierce, and when the canoe  touched the shore&mdash;oh, joy!&mdash;she saw her dear  father.
          
             &ldquo;Silver bell, silver bell, do not fear;
              To protect thee, Mirabella, I am here.&rdquo;
            
          
          She was so pleased to see her father again  and to hear him speak. It was so nice to be  loved, to be cared for, to be spoken kindly to.  Everything seemed to welcome her; the boughs  of the sacred palms waved in the summer  breeze, and the humming-birds, flitting about,  seemed like precious stones set in a glorious  blaze of light. Her father was not changed  very much; he looked somewhat younger and  stronger, and as he lifted her in his arms his  face seemed handsomer and his voice more  welcome. She felt no pang of sorrow, she had  no fears, for she was in her father&rsquo;s arms, to  which the fairy silver bells had led her.
          Farther up in the island she saw groups of  other children running to meet her, all with  silver bells around their necks; and some there  were among them whom she had known in the  Silver Islands. These had been playmates of  hers, but had left before her.
          So periods of light sped on, in which joy  was her companion, when, looking into a deep  but very clear pond, she saw a gnarled cork-tree,  which seemed to have been struck by lightning.  Long did she stand there gazing into it wondering  where she had seen that tree. All at  once she spied a canoe passing close by the tree, in which stood a young man, whom she  recognized as her step-brother Gliglu. He  seemed to cast a sorrowful look at the tree,  and then she recollected the fate of her mother.  At this moment her silver bell fell off, and,  sinking into the pond, it went down&mdash;down,  until it reached the tree, and, tinkling, said&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Take thy shape again, O queen!&rdquo;
            
          
          Then Mirabella saw her mother step into  the canoe; and tinkling bells in a short space  of time told her that others dear and near to  her had arrived, and, running down to the  shore, she cried out&mdash;
          
             &ldquo;Silver bells, O mother, wait you here,
              Nought but joy with father, nought to fear.&rdquo;
