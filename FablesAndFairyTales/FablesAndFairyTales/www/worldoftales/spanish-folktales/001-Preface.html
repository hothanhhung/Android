          I firmly believe that the following tales  have never seen the light of publicity.  They are the folklore of Spain and Portugal.
          Since the day when Hernando del Castillo,  in 1511, published some of the romances of  Spanish chivalry collected from the people,  various works have appeared at different times,  adding to the already rich store from that  inexhaustible mine of song and story.
          But, unfortunately for those who appreciate  originality in a people, it was discovered that  Boccaccio had been most unceremoniously  plagiarized, and, what was still worse, that his  defects had not been avoided.
          The &ldquo;Decameron&rdquo; has, in fact, been the  foundation of the majority of the romances attributed to the natives of the Peninsula when,  as has too often been the case, they have in  their songs of chivalry overstepped the limits  imposed by decorum.
          But this does not argue that the Spaniards  and Portuguese have no poetry and no folklore  of their own, but rather that the latter have  been ignored by the compilers of such literature,  in order to satisfy the cravings of the  unfortunately too many admirers, even in this  day, of that which would have been of advantage  to the world at large had it never been  imagined.
          In England the tale of &ldquo;Jack the Giant  Killer&rdquo; is read with avidity by all young people,  for it is a purely national tale; but in Spain  and Portugal such simple tales very seldom  find a publisher, and children, and even their  elders have to content themselves with hearing  them recited by those who enliven the long  wintry nights with such lore as I have  attempted to reproduce from my memory,  told me in my youth in the bosom of those  two sister lands which produced the Cid  Campeador and the Gran Vasco da Gama.
          And, before closing this preface, I would  remark that the North of Portugal, where I  was born and bred, is richer in folklore than  the rest of the kingdom, especially in tales  about enchanted Moors and warlocks, of whom  I, in common with the Portuguese, say,  &ldquo;Abernuncio.&rdquo;
