           There was once a king who had an only  daughter, and she was so very ugly and  deformed that, when she rode through the  streets of Alcantara, the children ran away,  thinking she was a witch.
          Her father, however, thought her the most  lovely creature in his kingdom; and as all the  courtiers agreed with him, and the Court poet  was always singing her praises, the princess  had been led to believe what most ladies like  to believe; and as she was expecting a prince  from a distant country, who was coming expressly  to marry her, she had ordered many  rich dresses which only made her look uglier.
          The city of Alcantara was ready to receive  Prince Alanbam, who was going to espouse the  Princess Altamira.
          Crowds thronged the streets, martial music  was heard everywhere, and in the public square a splendid throne had been erected for the  king, Princess Altamira, and Prince Alanbam.
          Around the throne were formed large bodies  of well-equipped cavalry, dark visaged warriors  clad in white and gold, and mounted on superb  Arab steeds.
          Behind the king, on his left side, stood the  royal barber with his retinue of apprentices;  and on his right side was seen Nab&oacute; the  headsman, a nigger of gigantic stature, with  his implement of office, an axe, over his  shoulder.
          Seated on the steps of the throne were a  number of musicians, and below these a guard  of honour, composed of foot soldiers dressed in  short vests, called &ldquo;aljubas,&rdquo; and wide lower  garments, and with their aljavas, or quivers,  full of bright arrows.
          From the throne the king could see the  splendid bridge on six pillars, built by Trajan,  along which a brilliant cavalcade was proceeding,  namely, the procession formed by Prince  Alanbam and his retainers.
          As soon as the prince, after saluting the  king, beheld the princess, he turned pale, for  he had never seen any one so ugly; and however  much he might have desired to keep up an appearance of courtesy to the princess before  her father&rsquo;s subjects, he could not kiss her as  she expected him to do, nor could he be persuaded  to occupy the chair reserved for him  beside the princess.
          &ldquo;Your mercy,&rdquo; said he, addressing the king,  &ldquo;must excuse my insuperable bashfulness; but  the fact is that the Princess Altamira is so  transcendently beautiful, and so dazzling to  behold, that I can never expect to look upon  her face again and live.&rdquo;
          The king and the princess were highly  flattered; but as Prince Alanbam continued  obdurate in his professions of bashfulness, they  commenced to feel somewhat vexed, and at  last the king said in a loud voice&mdash;
          &ldquo;Prince Alanbam, we fully appreciate the  motive that prompts your conduct, but the  fact is the Princess Altamira is present to be  wedded to you; and, as a Christian king, the  first of my line, I desire to lead to the altar  my only daughter, Princess Altamira, and her  affianced husband, Prince Alanbam.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I would  rather marry some one less beautiful. Sir  king, forgive me if I annoy you, but I will not  be wedded to so much beauty.&rdquo;
          The king was now incensed beyond measure,  and the princess his daughter, thinking to spite  Prince Alanbam, said&mdash;
          &ldquo;With your permission, royal father, since I  am too beautiful for a prince, I will be married  to the most learned man in your kingdom&mdash;Bernardo,  the royal barber.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;And that you shall,&rdquo; said the king; but, on  turning round to speak to the barber, he found  that this the most learned man in his kingdom  was all of a tremble, as if dancing to the music  of St. Vitus.
          &ldquo;What has possessed thee, caitiff?&rdquo; asked  the king. &ldquo;Hearest not thou the honour that  is to be conferred on thee?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;My royal master,&rdquo; muttered the poor  frightened man of learning and lather, &ldquo;I can  no more avail myself of the honour which  you would confer on me than the Archbishop  of Villafranca could. His grace is bound to  celibacy, and I am already married.&rdquo;
          Now, the barber had on many occasions  rendered himself obnoxious to Sanchez, the  royal cobbler, who, seeing the king&rsquo;s perplexity,  and a chance of avenging past insults, exclaimed&mdash;
          &ldquo;Royal master, it would be most acceptable to your subjects that so much beauty should be  wedded to so much learning. Our good friend,  Bernardo, was, it is true, married; but since he  has been in attendance at the palace, he has so  fallen in love with Princess Altamira that he no  longer notices his wife; therefore, may it please  your mercy to dissolve the first marriage, and  announce this new one with her highness, your  daughter?&rdquo;
          The barber at this harangue became so  infuriated that he rushed blindly at the cobbler,  and with his razor would have severed his  head from the rest of his body, but that he  was prevented by the guard, who held him  down.
          &ldquo;Executioner, do your work!&rdquo; cried the  baffled king; and at one blow the head of the  unfortunate barber rolled on the ground.
          Prince Alanbam seeing this, and fearing that  more mischief might ensue, proposed to the  king that one hundred knights should be chosen,  and that these should fight for the hand of the  lovely Princess Altamira. &ldquo;I myself will enter  the lists,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;and the survivor  will be rewarded by marrying your daughter.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;That is a good idea,&rdquo; said the king; and  calling together ninety-nine of his best knights, he bade them fight valiantly, for their reward  was very precious.
          Fifty knights, mounted on beautiful chargers,  placed themselves on one side, and were  opposed by forty-nine equally well-mounted  knights and Prince Alanbam; and at the word  of command, given by the king, they advanced  at headlong speed against each other; but,  much to the astonishment of the spectators, no  knight was unhorsed; rather did it seem that  each knight did his utmost to get run through  by his opponent.
          At it they went again and again, but with  the same result, for no man was hurt, although  seeming to court death.
          &ldquo;We will alter the order of things,&rdquo; exclaimed  the king. &ldquo;The knight who is first  wounded shall be the one to marry the  princess.&rdquo;
          This was no sooner said than the knights  seemed to be possessed of a blind fury, and  at the first charge nearly every knight was  unhorsed and every one wounded, while the  confusion and noise were awful. They were  all accusing each other of being the first  wounded; so that, in utter despair, the king  declared his daughter should be married to the Church, enter a convent, and thus hide her  transcendent beauty.
          &ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; exclaimed the ugly princess;  &ldquo;I will get a husband; and if in all the states  of Spain no one be found worthy enough to  be my husband, I will leave Spain for ever.  There is a country where the day never dawns,  and night is eternal. Thither will I go; for in  the dark, as all cats are gray, so are all degrees  of beauty brought to one common level. I  now know that it is just as unfortunate to be  too beautiful as it is to be very ugly.&rdquo;
          Having delivered herself of this speech,  Princess Altamira bade the king, her father,  good-bye, and was on the point of leaving the  royal presence, when the handsome figure of  Felisberto, the blind fiddler, was seen to  approach.
          &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; exclaimed blind Felisberto, &ldquo;to  Spain nothing is denied. You speak of proceeding  to the North, where the day never  dawns, in search of a husband. You need but  look at me to behold one to whom night  and day, extreme ugliness and transcendent  beauty, are alike; and since all are so bashful  that they will not marry you, allow me, fair  princess, to offer you my services as a husband. In my world &lsquo;handsome is that handsome  does.&rsquo;&rdquo;
          The king was so pleased with the blind  fiddler&rsquo;s speech that he immediately made him  a Grandee of Spain, and acknowledged him as  his son-in-law elect.
