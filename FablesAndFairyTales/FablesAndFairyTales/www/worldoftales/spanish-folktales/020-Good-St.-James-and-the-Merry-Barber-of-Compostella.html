          Just close to the cathedral of Compostella  lived a barber whose real name was Pedro  Moreno, but who was better known by that of  El Macho, &ldquo;the mule,&rdquo; because he was so stubborn  that if he happened to be playing the guitar,  he would not leave off though a dozen customers  were waiting to be shaved. But in Spain  a barber also applies leeches, draws teeth, and  extracts corns, so that it was very annoying  for a man who was suffering from tooth-ache,  and wanted his tooth taken out or stopped, to  have to wait until the barber had finished  playing on the guitar.
          He was also a soothsayer, and could repeat  the whole of the prophetical Buena Dicha by  heart. He was, in fact, the most useful man  in Compostella, and had cultivated the art of  shaving the face and head from the commencement which consists in watching the flies when  standing close to the master who is showing off  his skill on a customer, to being able to play  the guitar with such proficiency that, holding  the neck in his left hand and pressing the cords  with the fingers, he shall, by thumping the  instrument on the big toe of his left foot, cause  it to vibrate the air of the immortal Cachucha or the Bolero, while with his right hand he  plays the castanets.
          A barber may have his brass chin-basins,  which hang outside the door, burnished every  day; his fly-catcher renovated every month; his  bottles containing leeches nice and clean; and  he may know all the scandal of the town, which  is decidedly a part of his duty; but if he cannot  play the guitar and the castanets at the same  time&mdash;which he can only do by calling the big  toe of his left foot into requisition&mdash;he must not  be considered a barber of the first class. He  may do for shaving poor priests and water-carriers;  but he may not shave an abbot, nor  an archbishop, still less a grandee of Spain, who  may sit before the king with his hat on.
          In other countries the position of a barber is  somewhat less important than it used to be  when cleanliness required of a man that he should appear at early mass on the Sunday  well shaved; but in Spain, cleanliness of the  face is a great recommendation, for a rough  chin never earned kisses. Therefore is a barber  still held in great respect in the land of the  Cid; and although Don Pedro Moreno was  known by the name of &ldquo;El Macho,&rdquo; no one  would have dared address him thus.
          One day the archbishop called on El Macho  to request of him to come and look at the  image of St. James in the cathedral, to whom  the edifice is dedicated, because this miraculous  figure, who had wrought so many miracles, had,  strange to say, commenced letting his beard  grow, much to the astonishment of all the  priesthood and of the common people, and to  the dismay of several knights who had been  knighted at the altar of St. James, because in  those days knights did not use beards.
          The barber, seeing the archbishop enter his  house, advanced, knelt, and kissed his ring;  and, knowing on what errand he was come, he  was so solicitous of securing the archbishop&rsquo;s  favour, that he put aside his guitar, and respectfully  awaited the prelate&rsquo;s commands.
          The archbishop having informed Pedro of  the state of St. James&rsquo;s chin, proceeded to inform him that it had been decided, at a  meeting of the clergy, to entrust the shaving of  the saint to him, Pedro Moreno; but that, as  this growth of hair was most exceptional, seeing  that the image was of wood, it was probable  that the usual process of shaving might not be  sufficient.
          &ldquo;And you are quite right, most excellent sir,  in your supposition,&rdquo; exclaimed the barber; &ldquo;for  unless I obtain some of the holy water in which  the good saint was baptized, and a piece of  the soap with which Judas Iscariot greased the  rope with which he hanged himself, it will be  useless to try and shave him, for the hair will  grow as fast as it is taken off.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But that is impossible,&rdquo; answered the archbishop;  &ldquo;for we do not even know where the  good saint was baptized; and as for the soap  last used by the arch-traitor, I should not be  astonished to hear that Satan had taken it away  with him when he came to fetch Judas. No,  good Pedro; you must help me out of this  difficulty in some other manner.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Then we must do with St. James of Compostella  what the men of Burgos did with their  alcaide, who persisted in getting drunk when  he ought to have been getting sober. They got another alcaide as much like the other as possible,  excepting that he was not a borracho.  We must get another St. James like this one,  but without a beard, and the people will be  none the wiser.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;But,&rdquo; whispered the venerable archbishop,  &ldquo;what are we to do without our real, own,  good, sweet St. James, whose miracles have  been the means of restoring so many erring  ones to the fold, and bringing in so much  money to the Church? How can we replace  him? And then, again, where can we hide  him?&rdquo;
          &ldquo;All this can be arranged very easily,&rdquo;  answered El Macho. &ldquo;Any St. James will  perform the same miracles, for the people have  faith in him. It is the same with me; the  hidalgos have faith in me, and therefore believe  I am the only man in Compostella that can shave  them, although there are many other barbers.  It is the people&rsquo;s faith that performs the  miracles. As for hiding the saint, I will put  him in a box I have got, and lock him up  safely.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Fair sir, I leave the matter in your hands,&rdquo;  continued the archbishop; &ldquo;but beware lest the  people get to hear of it.&rdquo;
          And having said this he mounted his mule  and rode off.
          El Macho went in search of a sculptor, a  friend of his, and told him that he wanted an  image made exactly like that of St. Iago&rsquo;s in  the cathedral, because he had made a vow that  should he live single up to the age of fifty, he  would endow his parish church in Cordova with  a St. James. He pressed his friend to make  haste, and told him he would pay him well for  his trouble.
          At the end of ten days the image was  finished and handed over to the barber, who, in  the middle of the night, with the assistance of  the archbishop, entered the cathedral, took  down good St. James, disrobed him of his  armour, and having put it on the new St.  James, placed him on the altar, and then carried  the old image home.
          Having locked the door, he proceeded to  place the saint in the wooden box, but found  out that his legs were too long; so he cut two  holes in the side, through which he allowed  them to project, and, putting down the lid,  locked it.
          Next morning, after the first mass was over,  the people gave vent to their pleasure at seeing that St. James had a shaven face as formerly;  and the barber, who was at the door, gained  great praise by informing them that he had  been the unworthy means of shaving their  saintly patron.
          Now, the saint, who heard this from his box,  commenced to hit about him, and shouted  out&mdash;
          &ldquo;Good people, I am St. James with the  beard. El Macho is a villain!&rdquo;
          But the people laughed, thinking it was the  apprentice who was in the alcova, or inner  room, and had not got over the previous  night&rsquo;s drinking. So they went their way,  laughing at the idea of a beardless boy thinking  he was good St. James with the beard.
          Matters went on very well with regard to  the new St. James, who was not deficient in  working such miracles as the people liked to  ascribe to him and to believe of him. The  belted knights were pleased to find out that the  growing of a beard was only a passing fancy of  their patron; and as all were satisfied, and the  revenues increased, the priests were also well  pleased.
          Good St. James had been confined within his  box for about three months when the day for his annual procession came round, and great  preparations had been made for the occasion.  Each knight had sent his war-horse fully caparisoned,  led by two servants in the livery of the  family, and followed by his shield and spear-bearers.  There were about one hundred and  fifty such chargers which preceded the horse  bearing the image of St. James, who was kept  secure in the saddle by a knight walking on  each side, holding his legs, while another one  followed bearing his banner. Then came the  standard-bearers of the knights, each with a  page richly dressed, and then came the archbishop  under the pallio, surrounded by the  dignitaries of the cathedral and minor priests of  the neighbouring villages. All the holy brotherhoods  presented themselves in their different  coloured robes, with their gold and silver  crosses, their richly emblazoned banners; and  in their midst walked little girls dressed up to  imitate angels, while the little boys swung  censers of burning incense. In the rear came  twelve squadrons of cavalry, four batteries of  artillery, and five brigades of infantry, which  had arrived from different garrison towns to  take part in the procession. From every  window scarlet damask drapery hung, as well as from the balconies where the lovely daughters  of Spain in all their holiday grandeur appeared,  fanning themselves gracefully&mdash;which  art they have cultivated to the detriment of  conversation, which to them is still an art little  attended to.
          The streets through which the procession  had to pass were strewn with flowers, especially  fleurs-de-lis, and crowds had congregated on  the pavements.
          El Macho had given his apprentice a half-holiday,  and was standing outside his house,  speaking to some customers, when he suddenly  heard a great noise, and turning round he saw  that good St. James in the box was running  towards the cathedral from which the procession  was emerging. Peals of laughter and  shouts of &ldquo;El cajon&rdquo; (&ldquo;The box&rdquo;) were taken  up by the multitude; but, fortunately for El  Macho, they did not see from which house the  box on legs had come.
          Not waiting for admittance, and knocking  over the sentries at the door, the saint in the  box made straight for the archbishop, who,  knowing what it was, quietly walked into the  vestry, followed by St. James, and locked the  door.
          Then he undid the box, and beheld good St.  James with a three months&rsquo; beard on his chin,  who shouted&mdash;
          &ldquo;Have me shaved, good archbishop! Let  me take my place in this grand cavalcade, and  I promise not to grow a beard again.&rdquo;
          The archbishop enjoined silence; and calling  for one of his acolytes, he ordered him to stop  the procession for half an hour, to have the  horse carrying the other St. James led into the  enclosed yard, and send for the barber, El  Macho. This having been done, the barber  was ordered to shave the saint and put on his  armour, which the other one was wearing. This  did not take long; but even so the people  wondered at what had happened, which, however,  they were never to know&mdash;not even the  mystery of this box on legs&mdash;because the archbishop  issued a pastoral granting plenary absolution  to all such as should not ask him any  questions, and excommunication to all such as  should find out.
          Once again on horseback, and surrounded by  his faithful knights, St. James received the  homage of the vulgar crowds and of the lovely  ladies, and returned to his old place on the  altar.
          That he did not relish being locked up in  the box for three months is proved by the fact  that when, on three or four occasions, his vanity  got the better of him, and the archbishop  thought he saw signs of letting his beard grow,  it was quite sufficient to show him the big box  for him to withdraw the obnoxious bristles.
          The new St. James was presented to the  parish church at Cordova by El Macho, and  his vow having been thus accomplished, he  married the archbishop&rsquo;s niece, gave up business,  and died shortly after.
